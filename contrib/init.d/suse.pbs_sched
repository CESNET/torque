# Short-Description: Torque scheduler
# Description: Torque is a versatile batch system for SMPs and clusters.
#	Starts the PBS scheduler, which runs in conjunction with the PBS server.
#	it queries the server about the state of PBS and communicates with
#	pbs_mon to get information about the status of running jobs, memory
#	available etc.  It then makes decisions as to which jobs to run.
