 *  If base is zero, the base of the integer is determined by the way the

 *  followed by an "X" (either upper or lower case).
 *
 *  If base is greater than 1 and less than the number of characters in the
 * Long_dig array, it represents the base in which the number will be
 * interpreted.  Characters for digits beyond 9 are represented by the
 * letters of the alphabet, either upper case or lower case.
