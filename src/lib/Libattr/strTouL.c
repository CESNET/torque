 *      base.
 *
 *  If base is zero, the base of the integer is determined by the way the
 *  string starts.  The string is interpreted as decimal if the first
 *  character after leading white space and an optional sign is a digit
 *  between 1 and 9, inclusive.  The string is interpreted as octal if the
 *  first character after leading white space and an optional sign is the
 *  digit "0" and the next character is not an "X" (either upper or lower
 *  case).  The string is interpreted as hexidecimal if the first character
 *  after leading white space and an optional sign is the digit "0",
 *  followed by an "X" (either upper or lower case).
 *
 *  If base is greater than 1 and less than the number of characters in the
 * Long_dig array, it represents the base in which the number will be
 * interpreted.  Characters for digits beyond 9 are represented by the
 * letters of the alphabet, either upper case or lower case.
