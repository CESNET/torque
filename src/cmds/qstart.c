 * qstart
 *  The qstart command directs that a destination should start scheduling
 *  or routing batch jobs.
 *
 * Synopsis:
 *  qstart destination ...
 *
 * Arguments:
 *  destination ...
 *      A list of destinations.  A destination has one of the following
 *      three forms:
 *          queue
 *          @server
 *          queue@server
 *      If queue is specified, the request is to start the queue at
 *      the default server.  If @server is given, the request is to
 *      start all queues at the server.  If queue@server is used,
 *      the request is to start the named queue at the named server.
