# This is the config file for the scheduling policy
# FORMAT:  option: value prime_option
#	option 		- the name of what we are changing defined in config.h
#	value  		- can be boolean/string/numeric depending on the option
#	prime_option	- can be prime/non_prime/all ONLY FOR SOME OPTIONS

# Round Robin - 
#	run a job from each queue before running second job from the
#	first queue.

round_robin: False	all


# By Queue - 
#	run jobs by queues.
#       If it is not set, the scheduler will look at all the jobs on
#       on the server as one large queue, and ignore the queues set
#       by the administrator
#	PRIME OPTION

by_queue: True		prime
by_queue: True		non_prime


# Strict Fifo - 
#	run jobs in strict fifo order.  If one job can not run
#	move onto the next queue and do not run any more jobs
#	out of that queue even if some jobs in the queue could
#	be run.
#	If it is not set, it could very easily starve the large
#	resource using jobs.
#	PRIME OPTION

strict_fifo: false	ALL

#
# fair_share - schedule jobs based on usage and share values
#	PRIME OPTION
#
fair_share: false	ALL

# Help Starving Jobs - 
#	Jobs which have been waiting a long time will
#	be considered starving.  Once a job is considered
#	starving, the scheduler will not run any jobs 
#	until it can run all of the starving jobs.  
#	PRIME OPTION

help_starving_jobs	true	ALL

#
# sort_queues - sort queues by the priority attribute
#	PRIME OPTION
#
sort_queues	true	ALL

#
# load_balancing - load balance between timesharing nodes
#	PRIME OPTION
#
load_balancing: false	ALL

# sort_by:
# key:
# 	to sort the jobs on one key, specify it by sort_by
#	If multiple sorts are necessary, set sory_by to multi_sort
# 	specify the keys in order of sorting

# if round_robin or by_queue is set, the jobs will be sorted in their
# respective queues.  If not the entire server will be sorted.

# different sorts - defined in globals.c
# no_sort shortest_job_first longest_job_first smallest_memory_first 
# largest_memory_first high_priority_first low_priority_first multi_sort
# fair_share large_walltime_first short_walltime_first
#
#	PRIME OPTION
sort_by: shortest_job_first	ALL

# filter out prolific debug messages
# 256 are DEBUG2 messages 
#	NO PRIME OPTION
log_filter: 256

# all queues starting with this value are dedicated time queues
# i.e. dedtime or dedicatedtime would be dedtime queues
#	NO PRIME OPTION
dedicated_prefix: ded

# ignored queues
# you can specify up to 16 queues to be ignored by the scheduler
#ignore_queue: queue_name

# this defines how long before a job is considered starving.  If a job has 
# been queued for this long, it will be considered starving
#	NO PRIME OPTION
max_starve: 24:00:00

# The following three config values are meaningless with fair share turned off

# half_life - the half life of usage for fair share
#	NO PRIME OPTION
half_life: 24:00:00

# unknown_shares - the number of shares for the "unknown" group
#	NO PRIME OPTION
unknown_shares: 10

# sync_time - the amount of time between syncing the usage information to disk
#	NO PRIME OPTION
sync_time: 1:00:00
