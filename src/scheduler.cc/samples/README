Samples of PBS Schedulers Written in C.

The subdirectories in this directory contain source code for schedulers that
can be used if you choose "SCHD_TYPE = cc" (the default) when running configure
(before building PBS). You can indicate which of these schedulers you'd like to
build by naming it on the

		 --set-sched-code=xxxx 

option to configure (where "xxxx" is one of the following directory names).

The default scheduler, fifo, is intended to be used "out of the box" with
minimal configuration changes. The other schedulers are included as either
examples of scheduling approaches, or as optimized scheduler for specific
systems (that may require a bit more effort to configure to the local site,
but which should result in higher scheduling efficiency).


 Scheduler	Description
------------	------------------------------------------------------------
       fifo:	The default PBS scheduler implementing a variety of common
		scheduling algorithems, including: round-robin, by-queue,
		strict-fifo, fair-share, and load-balancing. Each of these
		can be further configured to use a variety of job sorting
		methods to indicate what class of job should be run first:
	 	no-sort, shortest, longest, smallest-memory, largest-memory,
		high-priority, low-priority, large-walltime, ascending-walltime,
		and combinations of these.




 sgi_origin:	A highly specially scheduler for the SGI Origin2000, providing
		integrated support for Array Services (for MPI programs), and
		NODEMASK (to pin applications via software to dynamically 
		created regions of nodes within the system). Scheduling
		algorithm includes a dynamic backfill implementation.
