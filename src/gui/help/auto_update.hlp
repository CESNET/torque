The Automatic Update dialog box is for specifying the interval number of minutes
for periodically taking updates of hosts, queues, and jobs data. 

Either type in the minutes value on the spinbox entry, or click on the 
scrollbar arrows of the spinbox to display valid values (> 0).

NOTE: If the "Manual Update" option is selected while auto update feature is
enabled, auto updating will automatically be canceled.
 
Click on the "start updating" command button to signal automatic updating 
of data.

Click on the "stop updating" command button to signal an end to automatic 
updates of data.

Click on the "close window" command button to close the dialog box. This is
also the default action (as indicated by a sunken look of the button) when the
<Return> key is pressed.
