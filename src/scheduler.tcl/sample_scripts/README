Samples of PBS Scheduler Scripts Written in TCL.

The sample Tcl based scheduler, loadavg,  included in this directory is
provided solely as an example of how a scheduler can be implemented
in the Tcl framework.  
 
This is a simple script that checks the system load average and starts the
first job if the average is under two.

Other sites have developed Tcl based schedulers.
