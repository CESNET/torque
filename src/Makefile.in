# Makefile for the PBS src directory
#
# First, read the manual!
#
# To build PBS:
#	1. Follow the direction in the Makefile one directory level above.
#
#	2. In general, it is is best to make everything from the level above,
#	   at least the first time.
#
#	3. Once the objects have been built one from the level above, any
#	   subtree can be rebuilt at its own level by typing "./make build"
