------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Notation:
    + new features were added
    - something was removed
    * code change
    F a bug was fixed
    o note

    (Xen)     only related to Xen
    (VServer) only related to Linux VServer
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

+   relation between each domain and the host on which it is running is
    reported to 'host' metric of pbs_cache process
F   pbs_cache may be compiled even on machines without Xen and VServer
+   each domain may be assigned to a cluster (the assignment is reported to
    'machine_cluster' metric of pbs_cache process)


CVS Tag r3_11 (2008-08-08)
==========================
+   NEWS file
+   -t <timeout> option for magrathea-admin
+   stop-master command for magrathea-admin to stop master daemon gracefully
*   (Xen) better scheduler settings: allow free domains to consume CPU power
    which is not consumed by Domain-0 and running domains


CVS Tag r3_10 (2008-08-04)
==========================
F   (Xen) 0750 permissions for /var/run/magrathea: deny access for others to
    the memory of frozen domains
*   after becoming daemons, master and slave log their parents' PID
F   (Xen) detecting memory assigned to domains with ID >= 10
+   magrathea-admin's status command prints status of all domains when issued
    without FQDN


CVS Tag r3_9  (2008-07-25)
==========================
+   support for building Debian packages
*   init script for master renamed to magrathea_master
*   init script for slave renamed to magrathea_slave
F   (Xen) detecting memory assigned to domains with short names
*   when listening on all interfaces, master daemon stores its current state
    in master.state.PORT instead of master.state.0.0.0.0.PORT (for IPv4) or
    master.state.::.PORT (for IPv6)
*   after becoming daemons, master and slave log their CVS Tag


CVS Tag r3_8  (2008-05-29)
==========================
+   (Xen) kernel helper shrinking domain's memory (faster than ballooning)


CVS Tag r3_7  (2008-05-26)
==========================
+   support for both Xen and VServer can be linked in the same binary with
    run-time detection of the VMM
+   slave's master-cmd.xen and master-cmd.vserver scripts were integrated into
    a single master-cmd script


CVS Tag r3_6  (2008-05-21)
==========================
+   IPv6 support


CVS Tag r3_5  (2008-05-19)
==========================
+   compile-time detection of Xen and VServer including incompatible changes
    in vserver.h
F   rebooting a domain in running* state
F   when CPU counting is off and a frozen domain exists, non-preemptible jobs
    must not be allowed in any other domain
F   timeout was removed when master is waiting for a defrosted domain to become
    available; anyway we cannot do anything clever if the domain is not ready
*   (Xen) better memory switching: detects memory assigned to each domain
+   -c <config_file> and -s <socket> options for magrathea-admin
*   init scripts refuse to start when the daemon is already running
F   CPU counters are always reset during startup
*   common master's init script for both Xen and VServer: even VServer contexts
    are started automatically when mentioned in /etc/magrathea/auto
*   each domain is described by "ID:status:CPUs" string when passed on to
    switch and switch-cpu scripts
+   (VServer) complete support for VServer; CPU counting requires kernel to be
    compiled with CONFIG_CPUSETS=y
+   VServer and Xen libraries may be linked in statically


CVS Tag r3_4  (2008-04-16)
==========================
+   debug=yes|no configuration option to switch on/off debugging messages
*   a priority domain with running jobs is reported as "running-priority"
    instead of just "running"


CVS Tag r3_3  (2008-04-14)
==========================
F   daemons do not ignore SIGCHLD anymore


CVS Tag r3_2  (2008-04-10)
==========================
+   both master and slave daemons detach themselves from a terminal and stay
    running in background; -d option disables this behavior and turns on debug
    messages
+   slave daemon logs when its master informs it about its domain being
    rebooted


CVS Tag r3_1  (2008-04-09)
==========================
+   processes of owners of all jobs are suspended when a domain is preempted
*   suspend and wakeup commands send by master to its slaves contain a number
    of jobs and their IDs
F   (Xen) switch script will wait forever when shrinking domain's memory, the
    timeout was removed


CVS Tag r3_0  (2008-03-26)
==========================
+   (Xen) PCI pass-through support for InfiniBand
+   domain life-cycle management (create, remove, boot, down commands for
    magrathea-admin)
+   reboot command for magrathea-admin and magrathea-cmd to request domain's
    restart; the domain gets CPU power and memory as if it was running jobs
-   domain's status can no longer be reported through pbs_mom, it is propagated
    only through pbs_cache
+   administrative interface to master daemon through magrathea-admin
*   /etc/magrathea/master configuration file instead of loads of command line
    options
F   no timeouts when master sends commands to its slaves; prevents master from
    doing something stupid, it's better when it is blocked 
+   support for any number of pbs_cache servers
+   each status string sent to pbs_cache includes a timestamp of the last
    status change
+   support for frozen domains
+   support for several running domains using CPU counting (not very useful for
    Xen, though, as master does not know how to switch memory)
