/**
 * @file
 * libghthash is a generic hash table used for storing arbitrary
 * data.
 *
 * Libghthash really stores pointers to data - the hash
 * table knows nothing about the actual type of the data.
 *
 * A simple example to get started can be found in the
 * <TT>example/simple.c</TT> file found in the distribution.
 * <TT>hash_test.c</TT> provides a more comlpete example.
 *
 * Some basic properties of the hash table are:
 *
 * - Both the data stored and the keys are of void type, which
 *   means that you can store any kind of data.
 *
 * - The only functions you probably will need to start is:
 *   - ght_create(), which creates a new hash table.
 *   - ght_insert(), which inserts a new entry into a table.
 *   - ght_get(), which searches for an entry.
 *   - ght_remove(), which removes and entry.
 *   - ght_finalize(), which destroys a hash table.
 *
 * - Inserting entries is done without first creating a key,
 *   i.e. you insert with the data, the datasize, the key and the
 *   key size directly.
 *
 * - The hash table copies the key data when inserting new
 *   entries. This means that you should <I>not</I> malloc() the key
 *   before inserting a new entry.
 *
