Kernel memory shrinking helper for Magrathea
============================================

Installed in Xen's domU, the helper will be automatically used by master-cmd
script to shrink domain's memory. It uses code provided by swsusp to speedup
ballooning.


1. Installation

DomU's kernel has to be patched with appropriate patch found in patches/
subdirectory and the module/ subdirectory has to be copied into kernel's
drivers/xen directory and renamed to magrathea. The easiest way to do this is
by running

    ./patch kernel_source_to_be_patched

Depending on CONFIG_MAGRATHEA option the helper will be built in or a separate
module called magrathea.ko will be created.


2. Usage

A simple interface to the helper is provided by /proc/magrathea/shrink file.
Read the file to obtain a list of available commands.
