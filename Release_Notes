This file contains a few notes on building and installing TORQUE and 
Release notes for each release.

New in 2.4.13
-------------

2.4.13 is a collection of bug fixes to the 2.4-fixes branch of TORQUE. To see a 
complete list of changes to 2.4.13 see the CHANGELOG in the distribution or you 
can view them at http://www.clusterresources.com/downloads/torque/CHANGELOGS/torque-2.4.13.CHANGELOG

NEW in 2.4.12
--------------

The buildutils/torque.spec.in file has been modified to comply more closely with RPM
standards. Users may experience some unexpected behavior from what they have experienced
in past versions of TORQUE. Please post your questions, problems and concerns to
the mailing list at torqueuers@supercluster.org

While Adaptive Computing distributes the files need to build RPMs as part of the build 
it does not support those files. Not every Linux distribution uses RPM. Adaptive Computing 
provides a single solution using make and make install that works across all Linux 
distributions and most UNIX systems. We recognize the RPM format provides many advantages 
for deployment but it is up to the indiviual site to repackage the TORQUE installation 
to match their individual needs.

If you have issues with the new spec files please post the issue or questions to the 
torque users (torqueusers@supercluster.org) mailing list


REQUIREMENTS
------------

An ANSI C compiler is required.   The native C compiler is recommended if it
is ANSI, otherwise use gcc.

A fully POSIX make is required.  If you are unable to "make" PBS with your
make, we suggest use of gmake from GNU.

Tcl/Tk version 8 or higher is required if you plan to build the GUI portion
of TORQUE or use a Tcl based scheduler.


BUILD AND INSTALLATION DIRECTIONS
---------------------------------

The directions to build and install are found the PBS Administrators Guide.
A postscript and PDF copy are found in this directory.  Please read and
following the directions CAREFULLY.
