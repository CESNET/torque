TORQUE Resource Manager

Software Version 3.0.3

This file contains a few notes on building and installing TORQUE and 
Release notes concerning some of the new features of this release.

		                   	-------- WARNING! --------

TORQUE 3.0 Communication Changes - WARNING: TORQUE 3.0 has upgraded the 
communication protocol to version 2 in order to accomodate the multi-mom
feature (explained below). pbs_server 3.0 will not be able to communicate with
pbs_moms pre-3.0, and vice versa. Additionally, schedulers will need to use the
updated TORQUE libraries in order to communicate with the updated TORQUE

TORQUE 2.5 Array Changes - WARNING: TORQUE 2.5 Job Arrays are not backwards
compatible, you MUST NOT upgrade to this from 2.3 or 2.4 while you have job
arrays queued - See README.array_changes for more details.

OVERVIEW

    The two main features of 3.0 are NUMA support and multi-mom capability.
    There are also several other minor enhancements and big fixes.
    For a complete list of changes see CHANGELOG.

    TORQUE 3.0 is not backward compatitble with any previous version of TORQUE.
    
    
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT'S NEW

    There is now a --enable-numa-support configure option to make pbs_mom
    compatible with NUMA systems. This has been extensively tested on UltraViolet
    and Altix hardware, and is currently in production at several sites.
    
    Essentially, this option allows pbs_mom to report "numa nodes" to the 
    server as subnodes of itself, and in turn the server reports those 
    "numa nodes" in the pbsnodes output. Numa support also creates cpusets
    around each job for its memory and cpus. There are many other features
    that accompany the NUMA support, so please refer to:
    http://www.clusterresources.com/products/torque/docs/1.7torqueonnuma.shtml

    New in 3.0 is the ability to run multiple pbs_mom daemons from the same 
    host. To learn more about the multi-mom capability see section 1.7
    of the TORQUE documentation found at http://www.clusterresources.com/products/torque/docs/index.shtml

    New in 3.0.4:
      Fixed a problem with job arrays when upgrading to verions 2.5.9. Please see
      the Installation section below for more details

      Fixed a problem with interactive jobs exiting prematurely.

      Added a new mom option $ext_pwd_retry which allows administrators to set the number
      of retries when checking for password validity.

      For a complete list of changes see the CHANGELOG.

    New in 3.0.3:
      There were several bug fixes to TORQUE 3.0.3. Following are a list of
      noteable bug fixes.

      Added function DIS_tcp_close which frees buffer memory used for sending
      and receiving tcp data. This reduces the running memory size of TORQUE.

      Fix for a server seg-fault when using the record_job_info.

      Fix for afteranyarray and afterokarry where dependent jobs would not
      run after the dependent array requirements were satisfied.

      Fix to delete .AR array files from the $TORQUE_HOME/server_priv/arrays
      directory.

      Fix to recover previous state of job arrays between restarts of pbs_server

      Fix to prevent the server from hanging when moving jobs from one server to
      another server

      Fix to stop a segfault if using munge and the munge daemon was not running

      Security fix to munge authorization to prevent users from gaining access
      to TORQUE when munge was not running.

      Fix to allow pam_pbssimpleauth to work properly.

      A new torque.cfg option as added named TRQ_IFNAME. This option allows the
      administrator to select the outbound tcp interface by interface name for 




REQUIREMENTS
------------

An ANSI C compiler is required.   The native C compiler is recommended if it
is ANSI, otherwise use gcc.

A fully POSIX make is required.  If you are unable to "make" PBS with your
make, we suggest use of gmake from GNU.

Tcl/Tk version 8 or higher is required if you plan to build the GUI portion
of TORQUE or use a Tcl based scheduler.


BUILD AND INSTALLATION DIRECTIONS
---------------------------------

The directions to build and install are found in the PBS Administrators Guide.
A postscript and PDF copy are found in this directory.  Please read and
follow the directions CAREFULLY.

Installation instructions can also be found at http://www.clusterresources.com/products/torque/docs/

TORQUE Upgrade Advisory

TORQUE versions 2.5.9 and 3.0.3 were released with a flaw which makes it impossible
to upgrade job arrays from previous 2.5.x and 3.0.x versions of TORQUE.  This
incompatibility has been fixed in TORQUE versions 2.5.10 and 3.0.4. Following is a
table which summarizes the upgrade procedure based on the current version being used.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To summarize, if you are upgrading from TORQUE versions 2.5.0 though 2.5.8 to 2.5.10
you only need to follow the standard upgrade instructions.

Similarly if you are upgrading from TORQUE versions 3.0.0 through 3.0.2 to 3.0.4 you
only need to follow the standard upgrade instructions.

When upgrading from 2.5.9 or 3.0.3 follow the standard upgrade instructions but start
pbs_server with the -u option on the first use only.  If you use the -u option to
start pbs_server on subsequent restarts an error message will be printed and pbs_server
will not start.
