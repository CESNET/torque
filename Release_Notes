This file contains a few notes on building and installing TORQUE and 
Release notes for each release.

TORQUE 2.5 Array Changes - WARNING: TORQUE 2.5 Job Arrays are not backwards
compatible, you MUST NOT upgrade to this from 2.3 or 2.4 while you have job
arrays queued - See README.array_changes for more details.



REQUIREMENTS
------------

An ANSI C compiler is required.   The native C compiler is recommended if it
is ANSI, otherwise use gcc.

A fully POSIX make is required.  If you are unable to "make" PBS with your
make, we suggest use of gmake from GNU.

Tcl/Tk version 8 or higher is required if you plan to build the GUI portion
of TORQUE or use a Tcl based scheduler.


BUILD AND INSTALLATION DIRECTIONS
---------------------------------

The directions to build and install are found in the PBS Administrators Guide.
A postscript and PDF copy are found in this directory.  Please read and
follow the directions CAREFULLY.
