a queue or server default established by the administrator.
Default value: no usage or no limit depending on specific resource.

.Tc Privileged Job Attributes
.Ig
.LP
The following attributes require system, manager, or operator privilege to set.
They are visible to clients depending on privilege as noted.
.Al comment
An attribute for displaying comments about the job from the system.
Visible to any client.
Format: any string; default value: none.
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
[internal type: string]
.Ig
.Al sched_hint
This attribute is present when the job is a member of a synchronous
dependency set.  It is set when the hold is released on the job.  The value is
.Sc SYNC_SCHED_HINT_FIRST
(1) when the first job of the set is released for scheduling.  This is a hint
that may be used by the scheduler to decrease the priority of the job.
This keeps a user from attempting to \*Qgame\*U the scheduler.  The attribute
is set to
.Sc SYNC_SCHED_HINT_OTHER
(2) for all other jobs in the set as they become schedulable.  This should be
taken as a hint by the scheduler to increase their priority to insure they
will run at the same time as the earlier scheduled jobs in the set.
[This attribute is viewable only by the batch administrator.]

.NH 3
.Tc Read-Only Job Attributes
.Ig
.LP
The following attributes are read-only, they are established by the
server and are visible to the client but cannot be set by a client.
Certain ones are only visible to privileged clients (those run by the
batch administrator).
.Al alt_id
For a few systems, such as Irix 6.x running Array Services, the session id
is insufficient to track which processes belong to the job.  Where a different
identifier is required, it is recorded in this attribute.   If set, it will
also be recorded in the end-of-job accounting record.
.IP
For Irix 6.x running Array Services, the alt_id attribute is set to the Array
Session Handle (ASH) assigned to the job.

job is executing.

The exit status of the job.  This is only set on receipt of a job obituary
notice from MOM, and probably only useful if the "keep_completed" server
attribute is set.  Note that negative values are generated internally by PBS to
indicate system errors and are listed as the JOB_EXEC_* defines in pbs_job.h.
Positive values are returned from the user script and cannot be interpreted by
PBS.
