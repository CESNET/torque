.Tc Server Public Attributes
.Ig
.LP
Server attributes can be read by any client; privilege is not required.
Most server attributes are alterable by a privileged client, run by
a user with administrator or operator privilege.
Certain attributes require the user to have full administrator privilege.
The following is a list of the server attributes.
.RS .25i
.Al acl_group_sloppy 
This is a default value for the queue attribute of the same name.
Format: boolean, "TRUE", "True", "true", "Y", "y", "1", "FALSE", "False",
"false", "N", "n", "0"; default value: false = disabled.
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
[internal type: boolean]
.Ig
.Al acl_host_enable
Attribute which when true directs the server to use the 
.I acl_hosts
access control lists.
Requires full manager privilege to set or alter.
Format: boolean, "TRUE", "True", "true", "Y", "y", "1", "FALSE", "False",
"false", "N", "n", "0";
default value: false = disabled.
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
[internal type: boolean]
.Ig
.Al acl_hosts
List of hosts which may request services from this server.
This list contains the network name of the hosts.
Local requests, i.e. from the server's host itself, are aways accepted even
if the host is not included in the list.
See section 10.1, Authorization, in the PBS External Reference Specification.
Requires full manager privilege to set or alter.
Format: "[+|-]hostname.domain[,...]";
default value: all hosts.
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig

.Al acl_logic_or 
This is a default value for the queue attribute of the same name.
Format: boolean, "TRUE", "True", "true", "Y", "y", "1", "FALSE", "False",
"false", "N", "n", "0"; default value: false = disabled.
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig

.Al acl_user_enable
Attribute which when true directs the server to use the server level
.I acl_users
access list.
Requires full manager privilege to set or alter.
Format: boolean (see acl_group_enable); default value: disabled.
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
[internal type: boolean]
.Ig
.Al acl_users
List of users allowed or denied the ability to make any requests of this 
server.
See section 10.1, Authorization, in the PBS External Reference Specification.  If acl_user_enable is set to true, only users listed in acl_users may submit to or execute jobs in the queue.
Requires full manager privilege to set or alter.
Format: "[+|-]user[@host][,...]";
default value: all users allowed.
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
[internal type:  access control list]
.Ig
.Al acl_roots
List of super users who may submit to and execute jobs at this server.
If the job execution id would be zero (0), then the job owner, root@host,
must be listed in this access control list or the job is rejected.
Format: "[+|-]user[@host][,...]";
default value: no root jobs allowed.
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig

.Al allow_node_submit
Allow job submissions from compute nodes regardless of ruserok().
Requires full manager privilege to set or alter.
Format: boolean; default value: disabled.
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
[internal type: boolean]
.Ig
.Al auto_node_np 
Automatically configure a node's np value based on the ncpus value from
the status update.
Requires full manager privilege to set or alter.
Format: boolean; default value: disabled.
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
[internal type: boolean]
.Ig 
.Al comment
A text string which may be set by the scheduler or other privileged client
to provide information to the batch system users. 
Format: any string; default value: none.
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
[internal type: string]
.Ig
.Al default_node
A node specification to use if there is no other supplied specification.
This attribute is only used by servers where a
.I nodes
file exist in the server_priv directory providing a list of nodes to the
server.  If the nodes file does not exist, this attribute is not set by
default and is ignored if set.  The default value allows for jobs to
share a single node.
Format: a node specification string;
default value: 1#shared.
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
[internal type: string]
.Ig
.Al default_queue
The queue which is the target queue when a request does not specify a queue
name.  Format: a queue name; 
default value: none, must be set to an existing queue.
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
[internal type: string]
.Ig
.Al down_on_error
Set a node's state to "down" if MOM reports a message beginning with the string
"ERROR".  This might interfere with moab's node error handling.  See the HEALTH
CHECK section in pbs_mom(8B).  This is an EXPERIMENTAL feature and may be
removed in the future.  Format: boolean; default value: false.
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
[internal type: boolean]
.Ig
.Al job_nanny
Enables the experimental "job deletion nanny" feature.  All job cancels will
create a repeating task that will resend KILL signals if the initial job cancel
failed.  Further job cancels will be rejected with the message "job cancel in
progress." This is useful for temporary failures with a job's execution node
during a job delete request.  It is possible that the job nanny might interfere
with job restarts, migrations, and checkpointing.  This is an EXPERIMENTAL
feature and may be removed in the future.  Format: boolean; default value: false.
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
[internal type: boolean]
.Ig
.Al job_stat_rate
Moderates how often job stat requests will be issued from pbs_server
to the MOM daemons.  If poll_jobs is unset or false, then all jobs that
haven't been updated in job_stat_rate seconds will trigger a stat request.  
If poll_jobs is true, then all jobs will be updated every job_stat_rate.
 (see poll_jobs)  On active clusters, 60 or 120 might be reasonable.
Default value: 45 seconds  (PBS_RESTAT_JOB in server_limits.h)
Minimum value: 4 seconds  (PBS_JOBSTAT_MIN in server_limits.h)
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
[internal type: integer]

by the execution queue attribute of the same name.
Format: integer; default value: 0.
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
[internal type: integer]
.Ig
.Al kill_delay
The amount of the time delay between the sending of SIGTERM and SIGKILL
when a qdel command is issued against a running job.  This is overriden
by the execution queue attribute of the same name. Format: integer
seconds; default value: 2 seconds.
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
[internal type: integer]
.Ig
.Al log_events
A bit string which specifies the type of events which are logged, see
the section on Event Logging in chapter 3 of the ERS.  Format: integer;
default value: 511, all events.
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
[internal type: integer]
.Ig
.Al log_file_max_size
If this is set to a value > 0 then pbs_server will roll the current log file
to logfile.1 when its size is greater than or equal to the value of
log_file_max_size. This value is interpreted as kilobytes.
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
[internal type: integer]
.Ig
.Al log_file_roll_depth
If this is set to a value >=1 and log_file_max_size is set then pbs_server
will continue rolling the log files to logfile.log_file_roll_depth.
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
[internal type: integer]
.Ig
.Al log_level
Controls the verbosity of server logs.  This value ranges from 0 to 7 with
7 representing maximum verbosity.  Format: integer; default value: 0, 
minimum verbosity.
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
[internal type: integer]
.Ig
.Al mail_domain
Override the default domain for outgoing mail messages.  If set, emails will be
addressed to "euser@mail_domain".  If unset, the job's Job_Owner attribute will
be used.  Format: a domain name; Default value: none.
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig

The uid from which server generated mail is sent to users.
Format: integer uid;
default value: 0 for root.

[internal type: integer]
.Ig
.Al managers
List of users granted batch administrator privileges.
Format:
.Ty "user@host.sub.domain[,user@host.sub.domain...]" .
The host, sub-domain, or domain name may be \*Qwild carded\*U by the use of
an \*Q*\*U character,  see the description of user access control lists in
chapter 10.1.1 of the ERS.
Requires full manager privilege to set or alter.
Default value: root on the local host.
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig

The maximum number of jobs allowed to be selected for execution at
any given time.
Advisory to the Scheduler, not enforced by the server.
Format: integer.
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
[internal type: integer]
.Ig
.Al max_user_run
The maximum number of jobs owned by a single user that are allowed to be
running from this queue at one time.  This attribute is advisory to the
Scheduler, it is not enforced by the server.  Format: integer; default
value: none.
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig

.Al max_group_run
The maximum number of jobs owned by any users in a single group that are
allowed to be running from this queue at one time.
This attribute is advisory to the Scheduler, it is not enforced by the server.
Format: integer; default value: none.
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
[internal type: integer]
.Ig
.Al mom_job_sync
Enables the "job sync on MOM" feature.   When MOMs send a status
update, and it includes a list of jobs, server will issue job deletes for any
jobs that don't actually exist.  Format: boolean; default value: false.
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
[internal type: boolean]
.Ig
.Al next_job_number
This hidden attribute is used to allow a manager to set the value of the 
next job ID via qmgr. This attribute should rarely be modified. Some sites 
may find it useful if they need to recreate their pbs_server 
database (perhaps due to a format change between major TORQUE versions) and 
they keep a database of job information indexed by the job ID. The manager 
should be careful to avoid setting the value to something that would allow 
the next job number to conflict with a job already queued, however Torque 
will handle this in a sane manner: the job submission will be rejected and 
the next job number will be incremented.
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
[internal type: integer]
.Ig
.Al net_counter
Lists the 3 numbers representing the number of connections in the last 5
seconds, 30 seconds, and 60 seconds.  This is a read-only attribute.
Format: string; default value: none.
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
[internal type: string]
.Ig
.Al node_check_rate
In OpenPBS, this was the rate at which pbs_server would poll each node.  In
TORQUE, nodes periodically send updates without solicitation from pbs_server;
this attribute is now used as the maximum number of seconds allowed without
an update before pbs_server will consider the node down.
Format: integer; default value: 150
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
[internal type: integer]
.Ig
.Al node_pack
Controls how multiple processor nodes are allocated to jobs.
If this attribute is set to true, jobs will be assigned to the multiple
processor nodes with the fewest free processors.
This packs jobs into the fewest possible nodes leaving multiple processor nodes
free for jobs which need many processors on a node.
If set to false,  jobs will be scattered across nodes reducing
conflicts over memory between jobs.   
If unset, the jobs are packed on nodes in the order that the nodes are 
declared to the server (in the nodes file).
Default value: unset \- assigned to nodes as nodes in order that were declared.
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
[internal type: boolean]

.Al operators
List of users granted batch operator privileges.
Format of the list is identical with
.At managers
above.
Requires full manager privilege to set or alter.
Default value: root on the local host.
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
[internal type: access control list]
.Ig
.Al poll_jobs
Controls how pbs_server will send job status requests to MOMs.  When unset or
false, statjob requests from clients (ie: qstat(1B) or the scheduler) may
trigger job status requests to MOMs and and must wait until the MOMs have
replied; this is suitable for small to medium sized clusters.  When set to
true, pbs_server will send periodic job status requests; this is suitable for
busy clusters with lots of jobs, lots of clients, qstat(1B) is too slow, or
your scheduler times out.  (see job_stat_rate) 
Default value: TRUE
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
[internal type: boolean]
.Ig
.Al query_other_jobs
The setting of this attribute controls if general users, other than the
job owner, are allowed to query the status of or select the job.
Format: boolean (see acl_host_enable);
Requires full manager privilege to set or alter.
default value: false - users may not query or select jobs owned by other users.
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
[internal type: boolean]
.Ig
.Al "resources_available"
The list of resource and amounts available to jobs run by this server.
The sum of the resource of each type used by all jobs running by this server
cannot exceed the total amount listed here.
Advisory to the Scheduler, not enforced by the server.
Format: "resources_available.resource_name=value[,...]".
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
[internal type: resource]
.Ig
.Al resources_cost
The cost factors of various types of resources.  These values are used in
determining the order of releasing members of synchronous job sets, see
the section on \*QSynchronize Job Starts.\*U  For the most part, these value
are purely arbitrary and have meaning only in the relative values between
systems.  The \*Qcost\*U of the resources requested by a job is the sum of the
products of the various 
.I resources_cost s
and the amount of each resource requested by the job.  
It is not necessary to assign a cost for each possible resource, only those
which the site wishes to be considered in synchronous job scheduling.
Format: "resources_cost.resource_name=value[,...]";
default value: none, cost of resource is not computed.
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
[internal type: list]
.Ig
.Al resources_default
The list of default resource values that are set as limits for a job 
executing on this server when the job does not specify a limit,
and there is no queue default.
Format: "resources_default.resource_name=value[,...]";
default value: no limit.
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
[internal type: resource]
.Ig
.Al resources_max
The maximum amount of each resource which can be requested by a single job
executing on this server if there is not a resources_max valued defined for
the queue in which the job resides.
Format: "resources_max.resource_name=value[,...]";
default value: infinite usage.
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
[internal type: resource]
.Ig
.Al scheduler_iteration
The time, in seconds, between iterations of attempts by the batch server
to schedule jobs.  On each iteration, the server examines the available
resources and runnable jobs to see if a job can be initiated.  This
examination also occurs whenever a running batch job terminates or a
new job is placed in the queued state in an execution queue.
Format: integer seconds; default value: 10 minutes, set by 
.Sc PBS_SCHEDULE_CYCLE
in server_limits.h.
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
[internal type: integer, displays as name defined below]
.Ig
.Al scheduling
Controls if the server will request job scheduling by the PBS job scheduler.
If true, the scheduler will be called as required; if false, the scheduler
will not be called and no job will be placed into execution unless the
server is directed to do so by an operator or administrator.  Setting or 
resetting this attribute to true results in an immediate call to the scheduler.
For more information, see the section
.B "Scheduler \- Server Interaction"
in the PBS Administrator Guide.
Format: boolean (see
acl_host_enable);
default value: value of -a option when server is invoked, if -a is not
specified, the value is recovered from the prior server run.  If it has never
been set, the value is "false".
