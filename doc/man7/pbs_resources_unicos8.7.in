.SH RESOURCE UNITS
The resource values take the following units:
.IP time 8
specifies a maximum time period the resource can be used.  Time is expressed
in seconds as an integer, or in the form:
.br
.Ty [[hours:]minutes:]seconds[.milliseconds]
.IP size 8
specifies the maximum amount in terms of bytes or words.  It is expressed
in the form
.Ty integer[suffix]
The suffix is a multiplier defined in the following table,
'b' means bytes (the default) and 'w' means words.
The size of a word is the word size on the execution host.
.RS
.IP "\ b\ or\ \ w" 12
bytes or words.
.IP "kb\ or\ kw"
Kilo (1024) bytes or words.
