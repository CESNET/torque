.Al default_node
A node specification to use if there is no other supplied specification.
This attribute is only used by servers where a
.I nodes
file exist in the server_priv directory providing a list of nodes to the
server.  If the nodes file does not exist, this attribute is not set by
default and is ignored if set.  The default value allows for jobs to
share a single node.
Format: a node specification string;
default value: 1#shared.

.Al down_on_error
Set a node's state to "down" if MOM reports a message beginning with the string
"ERROR".  This might interfere with moab's node error handling.  See the HEALTH

Format: integer; default value: not used.
.Ig
.Al job_nanny
Enables the "job deletion nanny" feature.  All job cancels will
create a repeating task that will resend KILL signals if the initial job cancel
failed.  Further job cancels will be rejected with the message "job cancel in
progress." This is useful for temporary failures with a job's execution node
during a job delete request.  It is possible that the job nanny might interfere
with job restarts, migrations, and checkpointing.  Format: boolean; default value: false.
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
[internal type: boolean]

.Al job_stat_rate
Moderates how often job stat requests will be issued from pbs_server
to the MOM daemons.  If poll_jobs is unset or false, then all jobs that
haven't been updated in job_stat_rate seconds will trigger a stat request.  
If poll_jobs is true, then all jobs will be updated every job_stat_rate.
 (see poll_jobs)  On active clusters, 60 or 120 might be reasonable.

.Al lock_file
Specifies the name and location of the lock file used to determine which high availability server should be active. 
.br
If a full path is specified, it is used verbatim by TORQUE. If a relative path is specified, TORQUE will prefix it with $TORQUE_HOME/server_priv.

Specifies the maximum number of jobs that can be in any requested job array. Arrays requesting more jobs than configured will be rejected.
Format: integer; default value: Unlimited.
.Ig
.Al max_slot_limit
No array can request a slot limit greater than 10. Any array that does not request a slot limit receives a slot limit of 10. Using the example above, slot requests greater than 10 are rejected.
A slot limit is the maximum number of jobs from an array that can run concurrently.
Format: integer; default value: Unlimited.

any given time.
Advisory to the Scheduler, not enforced by the server.

jobs that don't actually exist.  Format: boolean; default value: true.
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig

.Al next_job_number
This hidden attribute is used to allow a manager to set the value of the 
next job ID via qmgr. This attribute should rarely be modified. Some sites 
may find it useful if they need to recreate their pbs_server 
database (perhaps due to a format change between major TORQUE versions) and 
they keep a database of job information indexed by the job ID. The manager 
should be careful to avoid setting the value to something that would allow 
the next job number to conflict with a job already queued, however Torque 
will handle this in a sane manner: the job submission will be rejected and 
the next job number will be incremented.

.Al no_mail_force
This attribute can be set by a manager via qmgr. When set true, Torque will not
force mail to be sent to the user when the jobs mail_points is set to "\fBn\fP".
User will not receive notice of job failures or deletions. Format: boolean;
default value: false.
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig

.Al node_check_rate
In OpenPBS, this was the rate at which pbs_server would poll each node.  In
TORQUE, nodes periodically send updates without solicitation from pbs_server;
this attribute is now used as the maximum number of seconds allowed without
an update before pbs_server will consider the node down.
Format: integer; default value: 150

.Al node_ping_rate
Specifies the maximum interval (in seconds) between successive pings sent from the pbs_server daemon to the pbs_mom daemon to determine node/daemon health.
Format: integer; default value: 300
.Ig
.Al node_pack
Controls how multiple processor nodes are allocated to jobs.
If this attribute is set to true, jobs will be assigned to the multiple
processor nodes with the fewest free processors.
This packs jobs into the fewest possible nodes leaving multiple processor nodes
free for jobs which need many processors on a node.
If set to false,  jobs will be scattered across nodes reducing
conflicts over memory between jobs.   
If unset, the jobs are packed on nodes in the order that the nodes are 
declared to the server (in the nodes file).
Default value: unset \- assigned to nodes as nodes in order that were declared.

.Al node_suffix
Adds a domainname to node names before IP lookups.
Format: string; default value: none.

.Al np_default
np_default allows the administrator to unify the number of processors (np) on all nodes. The value can be dynamically changed. A value of 0 tells pbs_server to use the value of np found in the nodes file. The maximum value is 32767.
Format: integer; default value: not used.

above.
Requires full manager privilege to set or alter.
Default value: root on the local host.

Allows job owners to forcibly purge their own jobs from the server. This short-circuits
the normal flow of events and is hightly discouraged.
Default value: unset
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
[internal type: boolean]
.Ig
.Al poll_jobs
Controls how pbs_server will send job status requests to MOMs.  When unset or
false, statjob requests from clients (ie: qstat(1B) or the scheduler) may
trigger job status requests to MOMs and and must wait until the MOMs have
replied; this is suitable for small to medium sized clusters.  When set to
true, pbs_server will send periodic job status requests; this is suitable for
busy clusters with lots of jobs, lots of clients, qstat(1B) is too slow, or
your scheduler times out.  (see job_stat_rate) 
Default value: TRUE
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig

.Al query_other_jobs
The setting of this attribute controls if general users, other than the
job owner, are allowed to query the status of or select the job.

.Al "resources_available"
The list of resource and amounts available to jobs run by this server.
The sum of the resource of each type used by all jobs running by this server
cannot exceed the total amount listed here.
Advisory to the Scheduler, not enforced by the server.
Format: "resources_available.resource_name=value[,...]".

.Al resources_cost
The cost factors of various types of resources.  These values are used in
determining the order of releasing members of synchronous job sets, see
the section on \*QSynchronize Job Starts.\*U  For the most part, these value
are purely arbitrary and have meaning only in the relative values between
systems.  The \*Qcost\*U of the resources requested by a job is the sum of the
products of the various 
.I resources_cost s
and the amount of each resource requested by the job.  
It is not necessary to assign a cost for each possible resource, only those
which the site wishes to be considered in synchronous job scheduling.
Format: "resources_cost.resource_name=value[,...]";
default value: none, cost of resource is not computed.

.Al scheduler_iteration
The time, in seconds, between iterations of attempts by the batch server
to schedule jobs.  On each iteration, the server examines the available
resources and runnable jobs to see if a job can be initiated.  This
examination also occurs whenever a running batch job terminates or a
new job is placed in the queued state in an execution queue.

.Al scheduling
Controls if the server will request job scheduling by the PBS job scheduler.
If true, the scheduler will be called as required; if false, the scheduler
will not be called and no job will be placed into execution unless the
server is directed to do so by an operator or administrator.  Setting or 
resetting this attribute to true results in an immediate call to the scheduler.
For more information, see the section
.B "Scheduler \- Server Interaction"
in the PBS Administrator Guide.
Format: boolean (see
acl_host_enable);
