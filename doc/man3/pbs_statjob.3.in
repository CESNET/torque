.SH NAME
pbs_statjob \- obtain status of pbs batch jobs
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <pbs_error.h>
.br
#include <pbs_ifl.h>
.sp

.nf
struct batch_status *pbs_statjob(\^int\ connect, char\ *id,

.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
Issue a batch request to obtain the status of a specified batch job or
a set of jobs at a destination.
.LP
A
.I "Status Job"
batch request is generated and sent to the server over the connection
specified by
.Ar connect 
which is the return value of \fBpbs_connect\fP().
.LP
The parameter,
.Ar id ,
may be either a job identifier or a destination identifier.
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
If the string starts with a number, it is a job identifier.  
If it starts with a alphabetic character,
it is a destination identifier.
.Ig
.LP
If
.Ar id
is a job identifier, it is the identifier of the job
for which status is requested.  It is specified in the form:
.Ty "sequence_number.server"
.LP
If
.Ar id
is a destination identifier, it specifies that status of all jobs at the
destination (queue) which the user is authorized to see be returned.
If
.Ar id
is the null pointer or a null string, the status of each job at the
server which the user is authorized to see is returned.
.LP
The parameter,
.Ar attrib ,
is a pointer to an
.I attrl 
structure which is defined in pbs_ifl.h as:
.sp
.Ty
.nf
    struct attrl {
        struct attrl *next;
        char         *name;
        char         *resource;
        char         *value;
    };
.fi
.sp
.ft 1
The
.Ar attrib
.ft 1
list is terminated by the first entry where
.Ty next
is a null pointer.  If 
.Ar attrib
is given, then only the attributes in the list are returned by the server.
Otherwise, all the attributes of a job are returned.
When an
.Ar attrib
list is specified, the
.Ty name
member is a pointer to a attribute name as listed in pbs_alter(3) and
pbs_submit(3).  The
.Ty resource
member is only used if the name member is ATTR_l, otherwise it should be a
pointer to a null string.
The
.Ty value
member should aways be a pointer to a null string.
.LP
The parameter,
.Ar extend ,
is reserved for implementation defined extensions.  TORQUE 2.0.0p1 added the
#define'd constant string EXECQUEONLY to only retrieve jobs in execution
queues.
.LP
The return value 
is a pointer to a list of
.I batch_status
structures or the null pointer if no jobs can be queried for status.
The batch_status structure is defined in pbs_ifl.h as
.sp
.Ty
.nf
    struct batch_status {
        struct batch_status *next;
        char                *name;
        struct attrl        *attribs;
        char                *text;
    }
.fi
.ft 1
.LP
It is up the user to free the structure when no longer needed, by calling
\fBpbs_statfree\fP().
.LP
.SH "SEE ALSO"
qstat(1B) and pbs_connect(3B)
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
When the batch request generated by \fBpbs_statjob\fP()
function has been completed successfully and the status of each job has been 
returned by the batch server, the routine will return a pointer to the
list of batch_status structures.
If no jobs were available to query or an error occurred, a null pointer is
returned.  The global integer pbs_errno should be examined to determine
the cause.
