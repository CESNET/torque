.SH DESCRIPTION
Issue a batch request to shut down a batch server.  
This request requires the privilege level usually reserved for batch
operators and administrators.
.LP
A
.I "Server Shutdown"
batch request is generated and sent to the server over the connection
specified by
.Ar connect 
which is the return value of \fBpbs_connect\fP().
.LP
The parameter,
.Ar manner ,
specifies the manner in which the server is shut down.
The available manners are defined in pbs_ifl.h as:
.RS .25i
.IP #define\ SHUT_IMMEDIATE\ 0
Shutdown is to be immediate, runnings jobs are checkpointed, requeued, or
deleted as required.
.IP #define\ SHUT_DELAY\ 1
Jobs which can be checkpointed are checkpointed, terminated, and requeued.
Jobs which cannot be checkpointed but are rerunnable are terminated and
requeued.
Shutdown is delayed until the remaining running jobs complete.
No new jobs will be started by the server.
.RE
.LP
The server will not respond to the batch request until the server has
completed its termination procedure.
.LP
The parameter,
.Ar extend ,
is reserved for implementation defined extensions.
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig

return 0 (zero).
Otherwise, a non zero error is returned.  The error number is also set
