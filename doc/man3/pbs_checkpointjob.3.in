.SH DESCRIPTION
Issue a batch request to checkpoint a batch job.
.LP
For 
.I pbs_checkpointjob()
a "Checkpoint Job"
batch request is generated and sent to the server over the connection
specified by
.Ar connect 
which is the return value of \fBpbs_connect\fP().
The server will reply when the job has completed the checkpoint operation.
Checkpointing is only allowed for jobs that are marked as checkpointable.
.LP
These requests requires that the issuing user have operator or
administrator privilege.
.LP
The argument,
.Ar job_id ,
identifies which job is to be checkpointed, it is specified in the form:
.Ty "sequence_number.server"
.LP
The argument,
.Ar extend ,
is reserved for implementation defined extensions.

functions has been completed successfully by a batch server, the routines will
return 0 (zero). Otherwise, a non zero error is returned. The error number is
also set in pbs_errno.
