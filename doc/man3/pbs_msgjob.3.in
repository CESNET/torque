it is specified in the form:
.Ty "sequence_number.server"
.LP
The parameter,
.Ar file ,
indicates the file or files to which the message string is to be written.
The following values are defined in pbs_ifl.h:
.RS
.IP #define\ MSG_ERR\ 2
directs the message to the standard error stream of the job.
.IP #define\ MSG_OUT\ 1
directs the message to the standard output stream of the job.
