.SH NAME
pbs_alterjob - alter pbs batch job
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <pbs_error.h>
.br
#include <pbs_ifl.h>
.sp
.nf
.ft 3
int pbs_alterjob(\^int connect, char\ *job_id, struct\ attrl\ *attrib,
char\ *extend\^)
.fi
.ft 1
.SH DESCRIPTION
Issue a batch request to alter a batch job.
.LP
A
.I "Modify Job"
batch request is generated and sent to the server over the connection
specified by
.Ar connect 
which is the return value of \fBpbs_connect\fP().
.LP 
The argument,
.Ar job_id ,
identifies which job is to be altered, it is specified in the form:
.br
.Ty
\ \ \ \ sequence_number.server
.ft 1
.LP
The parameter,
.Ar attrib ,
is a pointer to an
.I attrl
structure which is defined in pbs_ifl.h as:
.sp
.Ty
.nf
    struct attrl {
        char *name;
        char *resource;
        char *value
        struct attrl *next;
    };
.fi
.sp
.ft 1
The 
.Ar attrib
list is terminated by the first entry where
.Ty next
is a null pointer.
.LP
The
.Ty name
member points to a string which is the name of the attribute.  The
.Ty value
member points to a string which is the value of the attribute.
The attribute names are defined in pbs_ifl.h:
.br
.RS
.IP #define\ ATTR_a\ "Execution_Time"
Alter the job's execution time.
.IP #define\ ATTR_A\ "Account_Name"
Alter the account string.
.IP #define\ ATTR_c\ "Checkpoint"
Alter the checkpoint interval.
.IP #define\ ATTR_e\ "Error_Path"
Alter the path name for the standard error of the job.
.IP #define\ ATTR_g\ "Group_List"
Alter the list of group names under which the job may execute.
.IP #define\ ATTR_h\ "Hold_Types"
Alter the hold types.
.IP #define\ ATTR_j\ "Join_Path"
Alter if standard error and standard output are joined (merged).
.IP #define\ ATTR_k\ "Keep_Files"
Alter which output of the job is kept on the execution host.
.IP #define\ ATTR_l\ "Resource_List"
Alter the value of a named resource.
.IP #define\ ATTR_m\ "Mail_Points"
Alter the points at which the server will send mail about the job.
.IP #define\ ATTR_M\ "Mail_Users"
Alter the list of users who would receive mail about the job.
.IP #define\ ATTR_N\ "Job_Name"
Alter the job name.
.IP #define\ ATTR_o\ "Output_Path"
Alter the path name for the standard output of the job.
.IP #define\ ATTR_p\ "Priority"
Alter the priority of the job.
.IP #define\ ATTR_r\ "Rerunable"
Alter the rerunable flag.
.IP #define\ ATTR_S\ "Shell_Path_List"
Alter the path to the shell which will interprets the job script.
.IP #define\ ATTR_u\ "User_List"
Alter the list of user names under which the job may execute.
.IP #define\ ATTR_v\ "Variable_List"
Alter the list of environmental variables which are to be exported to the job.
.IP #define\ ATTR_depend\ "depend"
Alter the inter-job dependencies.
.IP #define\ ATTR_stagein\ "stagein"
Alter the list of files to be staged-in before job execution.
.IP #define\ ATTR_stageout\ "stageout"
Alter the list of files to be staged-out after job execution.
.RE
.LP
If
.Ar attrib
itself is a null pointer, then no attributes are altered.
.LP
Associated with an attribute of type ATTR_l (the letter ell)
is a resource name indicated by
.Ty resource 
in the
.I attrl
structure.
All other attribute types should have a pointer to a null string ("") for
.Ty resource .
.LP
If the resource of the specified resource name is already present in the job's
.At Resource_List
attribute, it will be altered to the specified value.  If the resource
is not present in the attribute, it is added.
.LP
Certain attributes of a job may or may not be alterable depending on
the state of the job;  see \fBqalter\fP(1B).
.sp
.LP
The parameter,
.Ar extend ,
is reserved for implementation defined extensions.
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
It is not
currently used by this function.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
When the batch request generated by \fBpbs_alterjob\fP()
function has been completed successfully by a batch server, the routine will
return 0 (zero).
Otherwise, a non zero error is returned.  The error number is also set
in pbs_errno.
