.SH NAME
pbs_selstat \- obtain status of selected pbs batch jobs
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <pbs_error.h>
.br
#include <pbs_ifl.h>
.sp
.ft 3
.nf
struct batch_status *pbs_selstat(\^int\ connect, struct\ attropl\ *sel_list,
char\ *extend\^)
.sp
void pbs_statfree(\^struct batch_status *psj\^)
.fi
.ft 1
.SH DESCRIPTION
Issue a batch request to examine the status of jobs which meet certain criteria.
\fBpbs_selstat\fP() returns a list of batch_status structures for those jobs
which met the selection criteria.
.LP
This function is a combination of \fBpbs_selectjobs\fP() and
\fBpbs_statjob\fP().
It is an extension to the POSIX Batch standard.
.LP
Initially all batch jobs are selected for which the user is authorized to
query status.
This set may be reduced or filtered by specifying certain attributes
of the jobs.
.LP
A
.I "Select Status"
batch request is generated and sent to the server over the connection
specified by
.Ar connect 
which is the return value of \fBpbs_connect\fP().
.LP
The parameter,
.Ar sel_list ,
is a pointer to an
.I attropl 
structure which is defined in pbs_ifl.h as:
.sp
.Ty
.nf
    struct attropl {
        struct attropl *next;
        char           *name;
        char           *resource;
        char           *value;
        enum batch_op   op;
    };
.fi
.sp
.ft 1
The
.Ar sel_list
.ft 1
list is terminated by the first entry where
.Ty next
is a null pointer.
.LP
The
.Ty name
member points to a string which is the name of the attribute.
Not all of the job attributes may be used as a selection criteria.
The
.Ty resource
member points to a string which is the name of a resource.  This
member is only used when
.Ty name
is set to ATTR_l,
otherwise it should be a pointer to a null string.
The
.Ty value
member points to a string which is the value of the attribute or resource.
The attribute names are defined in pbs_ifl.h:
.br
.RS
.IP #define\ ATTR_a\ "Execution_Time"
Select based upon the job's execution time.
.IP #define\ ATTR_A\ "Account_Name"
Select (E) based upon the account string.
.IP #define\ ATTR_c\ "Checkpoint"
Select based upon the checkpoint interval.
.IP #define\ ATTR_e\ "Error_Path"
Select (E) based upon the name of the standard error file.
.IP #define\ ATTR_g\ "Group_List"
Select (E) based upon the list of group names under which the job may execute.
.IP #define\ ATTR_h\ "Hold_Types"
Select (E) based upon the hold types.
.IP #define\ ATTR_j\ "Join_Paths"
Select (E) based upon the value of the join list.
.IP #define\ ATTR_k\ "Keep_Files"
Select (E) based upon the value of the keep files list.
.IP #define\ ATTR_l\ "Resource_List"
Select based upon the value of the resource named in
.Ty resource .
.IP #define\ ATTR_m\ "Mail_Points"
Select (E) based upon the setting of the mail points attribute.
.IP #define\ ATTR_M\ "Mail_Users"
Select (E) based upon the list of user names to which mail will be sent.
.IP #define\ ATTR_N\ "Job_Name"
Select (E) based upon the job name.  
.IP #define\ ATTR_o\ "Output_Path"
Select (E) based upon the name of the standard output file.
.IP #define\ ATTR_p\ "Priority"
Select based upon the priority of the job.
.IP #define\ ATTR_q\ "destination"
Select based upon the specified destination.
Jobs selected are restricted to those residing in the named queue.
If destination is the null string, the default queue at the server
is assumed.
.IP #define\ ATTR_r\ "Rerunable"
Select (E) based upon the rerunable flag.
.IP #define\ ATTR_session\ "session_id"
Select based upon the session id assigned to running jobs.
.IP #define\ ATTR_S\ "Shell_Path_List"
Select (E) based upon the execution shell list.
.IP #define\ ATTR_u\ "User_List"
Select (E) based upon the owner of the jobs.
.IP #define\ ATTR_v\ "Variable_List"
Select (E) based upon the list of environment variables.
.IP #define\ ATTR_ctime\ "ctime"
Select based upon the creation time of the job.
.IP #define\ ATTR_depend\ "depend"
Select based upon the list of job dependencies.
.IP #define\ ATTR_mtime\ "mtime"
Select based upon the last modification time of the job.
.IP #define\ ATTR_qtime\ "qtime"
Select based upon the time of the job was placed into the current queue.
.IP #define\ ATTR_qtype\ "queue_type"
Select (E) base on the type of queue in which the job resides.
.IP #define\ ATTR_stagein\ "stagein"
Select based upon the list of files to be staged-in.
.IP #define\ ATTR_stageout\ "stageout"
Select based upon the list of files to be staged-out.
.IP #define\ ATTR_state\ "job_state"
Select based upon the state of the jobs.  State is not a job attribute,
but is included here to allow selection.
.RE
.LP
The 
.Ty op
member defines the operator in the logical expression:
.br
.Ty \ \ \ \ value\ operator\ current_value
.br 
The logical expression must evaluate as true for the job to be selected.
The permissible values of
.Ty op
are defined in pbs_ifl.h as:
.Ty "enum batch_op { ..., EQ, NE, GE, GT, LE, LT, ... };" .
The attributes marked with (E) in the description above may only be selected
with the equal, EQ, or not equal, NE, operators.
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
The full range of batch_op values is SET, UNSET, INCR, DECR,
EQ, NE, GE, GT, LE, and LT,
Only the relational operators are allowed
in a selstat call, and others will be rejected by the server.
.Ig
.LP
If
.Ar sel_list
itself is a null pointer, then no selection is done on
the basis of attributes.
.LP
The return value is a pointer to a list of
.I batch_status
structures or the null pointer if no jobs can be queried for status.
The batch_status structure is defined in pbs_ifl.h as
.sp
.Ty
.nf
    struct batch_status {
        struct batch_status *next;
        char                *name;
        struct attrl        *attribs;
        char                *text;
    }
.fi
.ft 1
.LP
The entry,
.Ty attribs ,
is a pointer to a list of attrl structures defined in
pbs_ifl.h as:
.sp
.Ty
.nf
    struct attrl {
        struct attrl *next;
        char         *name;
        char         *resource;
        char         *value;
    };
.fi
.ft 1
.LP
It is up the user to free the list of batch_status structures when no longer
needed, by calling \fBpbs_statfree\fP().
.LP
The parameter,
.Ar extend ,
is reserved for implementation defined extensions.  TORQUE 2.0.0p1 added the
#define'd constant string EXECQUEONLY to only retrieve jobs in execution
queues.
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
It is not
currently used by this function.
.Ig
.SH "SEE ALSO"
qselect(1B), pbs_alterjob(3B), pbs_connect(3B), pbs_statjob(3B), and 
pbs_selectjob(3B).
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
When the batch request generated by pbs_selstat()
function has been completed successfully by a batch server, the routine will
return a pointer to the list of batch_status structures.
If no jobs met the criteria or an error occurred, the return will be the
null pointer.  If an error occurred, the global integer pbs_errno will
be set to a non-zero value.
