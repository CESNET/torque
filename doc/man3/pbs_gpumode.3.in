.SH NAME
pbs_gpumode \- change GPU mode
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <pbs_error.h>
.br
#include <pbs_ifl.h>
.sp
.ft 3
.nf
int pbs_gpumode\^(\^int\ connect, char\ *mom_node, int gpu_id, int gpu_mode)
.fi
.ft 1
.SH DESCRIPTION
Issue a batch request for the pbs_mom to change the mode on one of
it's Nvidia GPUs.  The GPU's mode is changed by sending a
.I "GPU Control"
batch request to the batch server. 
.LP
This call requires PBS Operator or Manager privilege.
It also requires that Torque be configured with --enable-nvidia-gpu.
.LP
The argument,
.Ar mom_node ,
specifies the host within the cluster on which the GPU is located. The
argument is the name of a host that is a member of the cluster of hosts
managed by the server.
.LP
The argument, 
.Ar gpu_id ,
specifies ID of the GPU on the MOM node.
.LP
The argument, 
.Ar gpu_mode ,
specifies new mode of the GPU. Valid Nvidia GPU modes are:
.RS
.IP 0 2
- Normal mode.
.IP 1 2
- COMPUTE exclusive thread mode (only one COMPUTE thread is allowed to run on
the GPU).
.IP 2 2
- COMPUTE prohibited mode (no COMPUTE contexts are allowed to run on the GPU).
.IP 3 2
- COMPUTE exclusive process mode (only one COMPUTE process is allowed to run on
the GPU). This mode is new with Nvidia driver version 270.
.LP

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
When the batch request generated by the \fBpbs_gpumode\fP()
function has been completed successfully
by a batch server, the routine will return 0 (zero).
Otherwise, a non zero error is returned.  The error number is also set
in pbs_errno.
