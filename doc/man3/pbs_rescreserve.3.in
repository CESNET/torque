.B pbs_rescreserver
.br
Issue a request to the batch server to reserve specified resources.
.Ar connect
is the connection returned by \fBpbs_connect\fP().
.Ar resourcelist 
is an array of one or more strings specifying the resources to be queried.
.Ar arraysize
is the is the number of strings in resourcelist.
.Ar resource_id
is a pointer to a resource handle.
The pointer cannot be null.
If the present value of the resource handle is 
.B RESOURCE_T_NULL ,
this request is for a new reservation and if successful, a resource handle
will be returned in resource_id.
.IP
If the value of resource_id as supplied by the caller is not 
.B RESOURCE_T_NULL ,
this is a existing (partial) reservation.   Resources currently reserved 
for this handle will be released and the full reservation will be attempted
again.
If the caller wishes to release the resources allocated to a partial
reservation, the caller should pass the resource handle to 
\fBpbs_rescrelease\fP().
.IP
At the present time the only resources which may be specified are "nodes". 
It should be specified as 
.Ty nodes=specification
where specification is what a user specifies in the \-l option arguement list
for nodes, see 
.I qsub (1B).

.B pbs_rescrelease
.br
The \fBpbs_rescrelease\fP()
call releases or frees resources reserved with the resource handle of
.Ar resource_id
returned from a prior \fBpbs_rescreserve\fP() call.
.Ar connect
is the connection returned by \fBpbs_connect\fP().
.LP
Both functions require that the issuing user have operator or administrator
privilege.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
qsub(1B), pbs_connect(3B), pbs_disconnect(3B), pbs_rescquery(3B) and
pbs_resources(7B)
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
pbs_rescreserve() and pbs_rescrelease() return zero on success.
Otherwise, a non zero error is returned.  The error number is also set
in pbs_errno.
.IP PBSE_RMPART
is a special case indicating that some but not all of the requested resources
could be reserved; a partial reservation was made.  The reservation request
should either be rerequested with the returned handle or the partial 
resources released.
.IP PBSE_RMBADPARAM
a parameter is incorrect, such as a null for the pointer to the resource_id.
.IP PBSE_RMNOPARAM
a parameter is missing, such as a null resoruce list.
