.SH NAME
pbs_submit \- submit a pbs batch job
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <pbs_error.h>

#include <pbs_ifl.h>

.nf
char *pbs_submit(\^int\ connect, struct\ attropl\ *attrib,
char\ *script, char\ *destination, char\ *extend)
.fi
.ft 1
.SH DESCRIPTION
Issue a batch request to submit a new batch job.
.LP
A
.I "Queue Job"
batch request is generated and sent to the server over the connection
specified by
.Ar connect 
which is the return value of \fBpbs_connect\fP().
The job will be submitted to the queue specified by
.Ar destination .
.LP
The parameter,
.Ar attrib ,
is a list of
.I attropl
structures which is defined in pbs_ifl.h as:
.sp
.Ty
.nf
    struct attrl {
        char   *name;
        char   *resource;
        char   *value;
        struct attrl *next;
        enum batch_op op;
    };
.fi
.sp
.ft 1
The
.Ar attrib
list is terminated by the first entry where
.Ty next
is a null pointer.
.LP
The
.Ty name
member points to a string which is the name of the attribute.  The
.Ty value
member points to a string which is the value of the attribute.
The attribute names are defined in pbs_ifl.h:
.br
.RS
.IP #define\ ATTR_a\ "Execution_Time"
Defines the job's execution time.
.IP #define\ ATTR_A\ "Account_Name"
Defines the account string.
.IP #define\ ATTR_c\ "Checkpoint"
Defines the checkpoint interval.
.IP #define\ ATTR_e\ "Error_Path"
Defines the path name for the standard error of the job.
.IP #define\ ATTR_g\ "Group_List"
Defines the list of group names under which the job may execute.
.IP #define\ ATTR_h\ "Hold_Types"
Defines the hold types, the only allowable value string is 
.Ty \&"u" .
.IP #define\ ATTR_j\ "Join_Paths"
Defines whether standard error and standard output are joined (merged).
.IP #define\ ATTR_k\ "Keep_Files"
Defines which output of the job is kept on the execution host.
.IP #define\ ATTR_l\ "Resource_List"
Defines a resource required by the job.
.IP #define\ ATTR_m\ "Mail_Points"
Defines the points at which the server will send mail about the job.
.IP #define\ ATTR_M\ "Mail_Users"
Defines the list of users who would receive mail about the job.
.IP #define\ ATTR_N\ "Job_Name"
Defines the job name.
.IP #define\ ATTR_o\ "Output_Path"
Defines the path name for the standard output of the job.
.IP #define\ ATTR_p\ "Priority"
Defines the priority of the job.
.IP #define\ ATTR_r\ "Rerunable"
Defines the rerunable flag.
.IP #define\ ATTR_S\ "Shell_Path_List"
Defines the path to the shell which will interpret the job script.
.IP #define\ ATTR_t\ "job_array_request"
Requests specific array IDs. Makes this submission a job array submit.
.IP #define\ ATTR_u\ "User_List"
Defines the list of user names under which the job may execute.
.IP #define\ ATTR_v\ "Variable_List"
Defines the list of additional environment variables which are exported
to the job.
.IP #define\ ATTR_depend\ "depend"
Defines the inter\-job dependencies.
.IP #define\ ATTR_stagein\ "stagein"
Defines the list of files to be staged in prior to job execution.
.IP #define\ ATTR_stageout\ "stageout"
Defines the list of files to be staged out after job execution.
.RE
.LP
If an attribute is not named in the
.Ar attrib
array, the default action will be taken.  It will either be assigned
the default value or will not be passed with the job.  The action
depends on the attribute.
If
.Ar attrib
itself is a null pointer, then the default action will be taken for
each attribute.
.LP
Associated with an attribute of type ATTR_l (the letter ell)
is a resource name indicated by
.Ty resource 
in the
.I attrl
structure.
All other attribute types should have a pointer to a null string for
.Ty resource .
.LP
The
.Ty op
member is forced to a value of 
.Ty SET
by pbs_submit().
.LP
The parameter,
.Ar script ,
is the path name to the job script.  If the path name is relative, it will
be expanded to the processes current working directory.  If 
.Ar script
is a null pointer or the path name pointed to
is specified as the null string, no script is passed with the job.
.LP
The
.Ar destination
parameter specifies the destination for the job.  It is specified as:
.Ty [queue]
If
.Ar destination
is the null string or the queue is not specified, the destination will be
the default queue at the connected server.
.LP
The parameter,
.Ar extend ,
is reserved for implementation defined extensions.
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
It is not
currently used by this function.
.Ig
.LP
The return value is a character string which is the
.Ar job_identifier
assigned to the job by the server.
The space for the 
.Ar job_identifier
string is allocated by \fBpbs_submit\fP()
and should be released via a call to \fBfree\fP()
by the user when no longer needed.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
qsub(1B) and pbs_connect(3B)
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
When the batch request generated by pbs_submit()
function has been completed successfully by a batch server, the routine will
return a pointer to a character string which is the job identifier of the
submitted batch job.
Otherwise, a null pointer is returned and the error code is set in pbs_error.
