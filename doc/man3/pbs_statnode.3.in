.SH NAME
pbs_statnode \- obtain status of pbs nodes
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <pbs_error.h>
.br
#include <pbs_ifl.h>
.sp
.ft 3
struct batch_status *pbs_statnode(\^int\ connect, char\ *id,
struct\ attrl\ *attrib, char\ *extend)
.sp
void pbs_statfree(\^struct batch_status *psj\^)
.ft 1
.SH DESCRIPTION
Issue a batch request to obtain the status of a PBS node or nodes.
.LP
A
.I "Status Node"
batch request is generated and sent to the server over the connection
specified by
.Ar connect 
which is the return value of \fBpbs_connect\fP().
.LP
The 
.Ar id
is the name of a node
or the null string.  If 
.Ar id
specifies a node name, the status of that node will be returned.  If the
.Ar id
is a null string (or null pointer), the status of all
nodes at the server will be returned.  
.LP
In TORQUE 2.1.0, if the
.Ar id
starts with a ":" and followed by a node property, all nodes with that
property are returned; creating a "node group" functionality.  The
string ":ALL" is specially handled and is the same as passing a null
string.
.LP
The parameter,
.Ar attrib ,
is a pointer to an
.I attrl 
structure which is defined in pbs_ifl.h as:
.sp
.Ty
.nf
    struct attrl {
        struct attrl *next;
        char         *name;
        char         *resource;
        char         *value;
    };
.fi
.sp
.ft 1
The
.Ar attrib
.ft 1
list is terminated by the first entry where
.Ty next
is a null pointer.  If 
.Ar attrib
is given, then only the attributes in the list are returned by the server.
Otherwise, all the attributes of a node are returned.
When an
.Ar attrib
list is specified, the
.Ty name
member is a pointer to a attribute name.
The supported attribute names relating to nodes are
"state", "properties", "np", "ntype", "jobs", "status", and "note".
The
.Ty resource
member is not used and must be a pointer to a null string.
The
.Ty value
member should aways be a pointer to a null string.
.LP
The parameter,
.Ar extend ,
is reserved for implementation defined extensions.
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
It is not
currently used by this function.
.Ig
.LP
The return value is a pointer to a list of
.I batch_status
structures, which is defined in pbs_ifl.h as:
.sp
.Ty
.nf
    struct batch_status {
        struct batch_status *next;
        char                *name;
        struct attrl        *attribs;
        char                *text;
    }
.fi
.ft 1
.LP
It is up the user to free the structure when no longer needed, by calling
\fBpbs_statfree\fP().
.LP
.SH "SEE ALSO"
qstat(1B) and pbs_connect(3B)
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
When the batch request generated by \fBpbs_statnode\fP()
function has been completed successfully by a batch server, the routine will
return a pointer to the batch_status structure.
Otherwise, a null pointer is returned and the error code
is set in the global integer pbs_errno.
