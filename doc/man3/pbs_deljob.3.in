.SH NAME
pbs_deljob \- delete a pbs batch job
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <pbs_error.h>
.br
#include <pbs_ifl.h>
.sp
.ft 3
.nf
int pbs_deljob\^(\^int\ connect, char\ *job_id, char\ *extend\^)
.fi
.ft 1
.SH DESCRIPTION
Issue a batch request to delete a batch job.
If the batch job is running, the execution server will send the
.B SIGTERM
signal followed by
.B SIGKILL .
.LP
A 
.I "Delete Job"
batch request is generated and sent to the server over the connection
specified by
.Ar connect 
which is the return value of \fBpbs_connect\fP().
.LP
The argument,
.Ar job_id ,
identifies which job is to be deleted, it is specified in the form:
.Ty "sequence_number.server"
.LP
The argument, 
.Ar extend ,
is overloaded to serve two purposes.
If the pointer
.Ar extend
points to a string of the form:
.br
\fBdeldelay=nnnn\fP,
.ft 1
.br
it is used to provide control over the delay between sending 
.B SIGTERM
and 
.B SIGKILL
signals to a running job.
The characters \fBnnnn\fP
specify a unsigned decimal integer time delay in seconds.
If 
.Ar extend
is the null pointer or points to a null string,
the administrator established default time delay is used.
.LP
If 
.Ar extend
points to a string other than the above, it is taken as text to be appended
to the message mailed to to the job owner.   This mailing occurs if the
job is deleted by a user other than the job owner.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
qdel(1B) and pbs_connect(3B)
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
When the batch request generated by the \fBpbs_deljob\fP()
function has been completed successfully
by a batch server, the routine will return 0 (zero).
Otherwise, a non zero error is returned.  The error number is also set
in pbs_errno.
