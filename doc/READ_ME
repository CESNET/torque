The various troff files in the directories below here reference
the file ./ers.macros

Before they can be processed by troff or (the man pages) can be
installed in a man directory, this file must be merged into the source.

This is be done by the makefile that processes the document.

Because the program "soelim" is not always available and because it
needs to know in which directory to look for the so-ed file, a source
version is included in the doc directory.
