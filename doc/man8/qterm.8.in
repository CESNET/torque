.SH NAME
qterm \- terminate processing by a PBS batch server
.SH SYNOPSIS
qterm [\^\-t\ type\^] [server...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B qterm 
command terminates a PBS batch server.
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
The command sends a
.I "Server Shutdown"
batch request to the server.
.Ig
When a server receives a 
.if \n(Pb .ig Ig
terminate command,
.Ig
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
Shutdown request,
.Ig
the server will go into a
.I terminating
state.
While in this state, the server will not allow new jobs to be started or enqueued.
By default, qterm will request a "quick" shutdown of the PBS server.
Other ways of shutting down the server (specified with the \-t argument),
and their impact on running jobs, are described below.
The qterm command will not exit until the server has completed its shutdown
procedure.
.LP
In order to execute qterm, the user must have PBS Operation or Manager
privilege.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\-t type" 10
Specifies the type of shut down.  The types are:
.RS
.IP immediate
All running jobs are to immediately stop execution.  
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
The value passed in the
.I Shutdown
request is 
.Sc SHUT_IMMEDIATE .
.Ig
.IP
If checkpoint is supported, running jobs that were submitted with "\-c shutdown"
are checkpointed, terminated, and requeued.
If checkpoint is not supported or the job cannot be checkpointed, running
jobs are requeued if the
.At rerunable
attribute is true.  Otherwise, jobs are killed.
.IP
Normally the server will not shutdown until there are no jobs in the running
state.  If the server is unable to contact the MOM of running job, the job
is still listed as running.
The server may be forced down by a second \*Qqterm \-t immediate\*U
command.
.IP delay\ 
If checkpoint is supported, running jobs that were submitted with "\-c shutdown"
are checkpointed, terminated, and requeued.
If a job cannot be checkpointed, but can be rerun, the job is terminated
and requeued.
Otherwise, running jobs are allowed to continue to run.
Note, the operator or administrator may use the qrerun and qdel commands to
remove running jobs.
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
The value passed in the
.I Shutdown
request is 
.Sc SHUT_DELAY .
.Ig
.IP quick\ 
This option is used when you wish that running jobs be left running when
the server shuts down.  The
server will cleanly shutdown and can be restarted when desired.  Upon restart
of the server, jobs that continue to run are shown as running; jobs that 
terminated during the server's absence will be placed into the exiting state.
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
The value passed in the
.I Shutdown
request is 
.SC SHUT_NOW .
.Ig
.RE
.LP
.SH OPERANDS
The
.Ar server
operand specifies which servers are to shutdown.
If no servers are given, then the default server will be terminated.
.SH STANDARD ERROR
The
qterm
command will write a diagnostic message to standard error for
each error occurrence.
.SH EXIT STATUS
Upon successful processing of all the operands presented to the
qterm
command, the exit status will be a value of zero.
.LP
If the qterm command fails to process any operand, the
command exits with a value greater than zero.
