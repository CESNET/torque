.SH NAME
qmgr \- pbs batch system manager
.SH SYNOPSIS
qmgr [\^\-a\^] [\^\-c\ command\^] [\^\-e\^] [\^\-n\^]
[\^\-z\^] [\^server...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B qmgr
command provides an administrator interface to the batch system.
.LP
The command reads directives from standard input.  The syntax of each
directive is checked and the appropriate request is sent to the
batch server or servers.
.LP
The list or print subcommands of qmgr can be executed by general users.
Creating or deleting a queue requries PBS Manager privilege.  Setting or
unsetting server or queue attributes requires PBS Operator or Manager privilege.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\-a" 12
Abort
.B qmgr 
on any syntax errors or any requests rejected by a server.
.IP "\-c command"
Execute a single
.Ar command
and exit
.B qmgr .
.IP "\-e"
Echo all commands to standard output.
.IP "\-n"
No commands are executed, syntax checking only is performed.
.IP "\-z"
No errors are written to standard error.
.LP
.SH OPERANDS
The
.Ar server 
operands identify the name of the batch server to which the administrator
requests are sent.  Each
.Ar server
conforms to the following syntax:
.br
.Ty \ \ \ \ host_name[:port]
.br
where
.Ty host_name
is the network name of the host on which the server is running and
.Ty port
is the port number to which to connect.  If
.Ty port 
is not specified, the default port number is used.
.LP
If 
.Ar server
is not specified, the administrator requests are sent to the local
server.
.SH STANDARD INPUT
The
.B qmgr
command reads standard input for directives until end of file is reached,
or the
.I exit 
or
.I quit
directive is read.
.SH STANDARD OUTPUT
If Standard Output is connected to a terminal, a command prompt will
be written to standard output when qmgr is ready to read a directive.
.LP
If the
.Ar \-e
option is specified, 
.B qmgr
will echo the directives read from standard input to standard output.
.SH STANDARD ERROR
If the
.Ar \-z
option is not specified, the qmgr command will write a diagnostic message
to standard error for each error occurrence.
.SH EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
If
.B qmgr
is invoked without the
.Ar \-c
option and standard output is connected to a terminal, qmgr will write a
prompt to standard output and read a directive from
standard input.
.LP
Commands can be abbreviated to their minimum unambiguous form.
A command is terminated by a new line character or a semicolon, ";",
character.  Multiple commands may be entered on a single line.
A command may extend across lines by escaping the new line character
with a back-slash "\\".
.LP
Comments begin with the # character and continue to end of the line.
Comments and blank lines are ignored by qmgr.
.SH DIRECTIVE SYNTAX
A qmgr directive is one of the following forms:
.sp
.Ty "command\ server\ [names]\ [attr\ OP\ value[,attr\ OP\ value,...]]"
.br
.Ty "command\ queue\ [names]\ [attr\ OP\ value[,attr\ OP\ value,...]]"
.br
.Ty "command\ node\ [names]\ [attr\ OP\ value[,attr\ OP\ value,...]]"
.sp
Where, 
.IP command 10
is the command to perform on a object.  Commands are:
.RS
.IP active 10
sets the active objects.  If the active objects are specified, and the name is 
not given in a qmgr cmd the active object names will be used.
.IP create 10
is to create a new object, applies to queues and nodes.
.IP delete 10
is to destroy an existing object, applies to queues and nodes.
.IP set 10
is to define or alter attribute values of the object.
.IP unset 10
is to clear the value of attributes of the object.
Note, this form does not accept an OP and value, only the
attribute name.
.IP list 10
is to list the current attributes and associated values of the object.
.IP print 10
is to print all the queue and server attributes in a format that will be usable
as input to the qmgr command.
.RE
.IP names
is a list of one or more names of specific objects
The name list is in the form:
.br
.Ty "\ \ [name][@server][,queue_name[@server]...]"
.br
with no intervening white space.
The name of an object is declared when the object is first created.  If the 
name is @server, then all the objects of specified type at the server will be 
effected.
.IP attr
specifies the name of an attribute
of the object which is to be set or modified.
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
The attributes of objects are described in section 2 of the ERS.
.Ig
If the attribute is one which consist of a set of resources, then the
attribute is specified in the form:
.br
\ \ \fBattribute_name.resource_name\fP
.br
.IP OP
operation to be performed with the attribute and its value:
.RS
.IP =
set the value of the attribute.  If the attribute has a existing value, the
current value is replaced with the new value.
.IP +=
increase the current value of the attribute by the amount in the new value.
.IP \-=
decrease the current value of the attribute by the amount in the new value.
.RE
.IP value
the value to assign to an attribute.  If the value includes white space,
commas or other special characters, such as the # character,
the value string must be inclosed in quote marks (").
.LP
The following are examples of qmgr directives:
.sp
.ft 5
.nf
.Ty "create queue fast priority=10,queue_type=e,enabled = true,max_running=0"
.Ty "set queue fast max_running +=2"
.Ty "create queue little"
.Ty "set queue little resources_max.mem=8mw,resources_max.cput=10"
.Ty "unset queue fast max_running"
.Ty "set node state = down,offline"
.Ty "active server s1,s2,s3"
.Ty "list queue @server1"
.Ty "set queue max_running = 10	- uses active queues"
.fi
.ft 1
.LP
.SH EXIT STATUS
Upon successful processing of all the operands presented to the
qmgr
command, the exit status will be a value of zero.
.LP
If the qmgr command fails to process any operand, the
command exits with a value greater than zero.
