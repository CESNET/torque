[\-h hold_list] [\-j join] [\-k keep] [\-l resource_list] 
[\-m mail_options] [\-M user_list] [\-N name] [\-o path] [\-p priority]
[\-r c] [\-S path] [-t array_range] [\-u user_list] [\-W additional_attributes]
job_identifier...
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B qalter
command modifies the attributes of the job or jobs specified
by
.Ar "job_identifier"
on the command line.
Only those attributes listed as options on the command will be modified.  
If any of the specified attributes cannot be modified for a job for any reason, 
none of that job's attributes will be modified.
.LP
The qalter
command accomplishes the modifications by sending a
.I "Modify Job"
batch request to the batch server which owns each job.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\-a date_time" 8
Replaces the 
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
attribute
.At Execution_Time
.Ig
time at which the job becomes eligible for execution.
The
.Ar date_time
argument syntax is: 
.Ty "[[[[CC]YY]MM]DD]hhmm[.SS]" .
.IP
If the month,
.Ty MM ,
is not specified, it will default to the current month if the specified day
.Ty DD ,
is in the future.  Otherwise, the month will be set to next month.
Likewise, if the day,
.Ty DD ,
is not specified, it will default to today if the time
.Ty hhmm
is in the future.  Otherwise, the day will be set to tomorrow.
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
This 
.Ar date_time
will be converted to the integer number of seconds since Epoch that is
equivalent to the local time on the system where the command is being executed.
.Ig
.IP
This attribute can be altered once the job has begun execution, but it will
not take affect until the job is rerun.
.IP "\-A account_string " 8
Replaces the
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
the
.At Account_Name
attribute,
.Ig
the account string associated with the job.
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
The syntax of the
.Ar account_string
is defined in section 2.7.1. It is interpreted by the server which executes 
the job.
.Ig
.IP
This attribute cannot be altered once the job has begun execution.
.IP "\-c interval" 8
Replaces the
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
.At Checkpoint
attribute,
.Ig
the interval at which the job will be checkpointed.
If the job executes upon a host which does not support checkpoint,
this option will be ignored.
.IP
The
.Ar interval
argument is specified as:
.RS
.IP n 4
No checkpointing is to be performed.
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
The job's 
.At Checkpoint
attribute is set to the string
.Ty """n""" .
.Ig
.IP s 4
Checkpointing is to be performed only when the server executing the job is
shutdown.
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
The job's
.At Checkpoint
attribute is set to the string
.Ty """s""" .
.Ig
.IP c 4
Checkpointing is to be performed at the default minimum cpu time for the
queue from which the job is executing.
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
The job's
.At Checkpoint
attribute is set to the string
.Ty """c""" .
.Ig
.IP c=minutes 3
Checkpointing is to be performed at an interval of
.Ar minutes ,
which is the integer number of minutes of CPU time used by the job.
This value must be greater than zero.
If the number is less than the default checkpoint time, the default time
will be used.
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
The
.At Checkpoint
attributes is set to the string specified by
.Ar """c=minutes""" .
.Ig
.RE
.IP
This attribute can be altered once the job has begun execution, but the
new value does not take affect until the job is rerun.
.IP "\-e path" 8
Replaces the 
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
.At Error_Path
attribute,
.Ig
the path to be used for the standard error stream of the batch job.
The
.Ar path
argument is of the form:
.br
.Ty "\ \ \ \ [hostname:]path_name"
.br
where 
.Ty hostname
is the name of a host to which the file will be returned and
.Ty path_name
is the path
name on that host in the syntax recognized by POSIX 1003.1.
The argument will be interpreted as follows:
.RS
.IP \fBpath_name\fP
Where path_name is not an absolute path name, then the qalter command will
expand the path name relative to the current working directory of the command.
The command will supply the name of the host upon which it is executing for the
.Ar hostname
component.
.IP \fBhostname:path_name\fP
Where path_name is not an absolute path name, then the qalter command will
not expand the path name.  The execution server will expand it relative to
the home directory of the user on the system specified by hostname.
.IP \fBpath_name\fP
Where path_name specifies an absolute path name, then qalter will supply
the name of the host on which it is executing for the
.Ar hostname .
.IP \fBhostname:path_name\fP
Where path_name specifies an absolute path name, the path will be used as
specified.
.RE
.IP
This attribute can be altered once the job has begun execution, but it will
not take affect until the job is rerun.
.IP "\-h hold_list" 8
Updates the 
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
.At Hold_Types
attribute,

.IP o 5
Add the OTHER (or OPERATOR )
type hold if the user has the appropriate level of privilege.
[Typically reserved to the batch administrator and batch operator.]
.IP n 5
Set to none; that is clear the hold types which could be applied with
the users level of privilege.
.RE
.IP
Repetition of characters is permitted, but "n" may not appear in the same
option argument with the other three characters.
This attribute can be altered once the job has begun execution, but the
hold will not take affect until the job is rerun.
.IP "\-j join" 8
Declares which standard streams of the job will be merged together.  The
.Ar join
argument value may be the characters "oe" and "eo", or the
single character "n".
.IP
A argument value of
.Ty oe
directs that the standard output and standard error streams of the job will
be merged, intermixed, and returned as the standard output.
A argument value of
.Ty eo
directs that the standard output and standard error streams of the job will
be merged, intermixed, and returned as the standard error.
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
The
.At Join_Path
job attribute is set to the value.
.Ig
.IP
A value of
.Ty n
directs that the two streams will be two separate files.
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
The
.At Join_Path
attribute is set to "n".
.Ig
This attribute can be altered once the job has begun execution, but it will
not take affect until the job is rerun.
.IP "\-k keep" 8
Defines which if either of standard output or standard error of the job
will be retained on the execution host.
If set for a stream, this option overrides the path name for that stream.
.IP
The argument is either the single letter "\fBe\fP", "\fBo\fP", or "\fBn\fP",
or one or more of the letters "\fBe\fP" and "\fBo\fP"
combined in either order.
.RS
.IP n 5
No streams are to be retained.
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
The 
.At Keep_Files
attribute is set to KEEP_NONE, "n".
.Ig
.IP e 5
The standard error stream is to retained on the execution host.
The  stream will be placed in the home directory of the user under whose
user id the job executed.  The file name will be the default file name
given by:
job_name.\fBe\fPsequence
where \fBjob_name\fP is the name specified for the job, and \fBsequence\fP is
the sequence number component of the job identifier.
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
The attribute is set to include KEEP_ERROR, "e".
.Ig
.IP o 5
The standard output stream is to be retained on the execution host.
The  stream will be placed in the home directory of the user under whose
user id the job executed.  The file name will be the default file name
given by: job_name.\fBo\fPsequence
where \fBjob_name\fP is the name specified for the job, and \fBsequence\fP is
the sequence number component of the job identifier.
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig

.RE
.IP
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
Repetition of characters is permitted, but "n" may not appear in the same
option argument with the other two characters.
.Ig
This attribute cannot be altered once the job has begun execution.
.IP "\-l resource_list " 8
Modifies the 
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
.At Resource_List
attribute, the
.Ig
list of resources that are required by the job.
The 
.Ar Resource_List
argument is in the following syntax:
.br
.Ty resource_name[=[value]][,resource_name[=[value]],...]
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
.IP
For each resource listed,
if a resource with the specified name already exist in the jobs resource
attribute, the value for that resource will be updated.
If the named resource does not exist in the job resource attribute,
the resource name and value will be added.
No white space is allowed in the value.
.IP
Because the list of supported resources vary from host to host, the command
will perform no validation of the name or value.  
.Ig
.IP
If a requested modification to a resource would exceed the resource limits
for jobs in the current queue, the server will reject the request.
.IP
If the job is running, only certain, resources can be altered.
Which resources can be altered in the run state is system dependent.
A user may only lower the limit for those resources.
