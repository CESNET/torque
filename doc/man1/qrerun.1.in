.SH NAME
qrerun \- rerun a pbs batch job
.SH SYNOPSIS
qrerun [\-f]
job_identifier ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
The 
.B qrerun
command directs that the specified jobs are to be rerun if possible.
.LP
To rerun a job is to terminate the session leader of the job
and return the job to the queued state in the execution queue in which
the job currently resides.
.LP
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
The qrerun command sends a 
.I "Rerun Job"
batch request to the server which owns the job.
.Ig
.LP
If a job is marked as not rerunable then the rerun request
will fail for that job.
If the mini-server running the job is down, or the rejects the request, the
.I "Rerun Job"
batch request will return a failure unless \-f is used.
.LP
Using \-f violates IEEE Batch Processing Services Std and should be handled with
great care.  It should only be used under exceptional circumstances.  Best
practice is to fix the problem mini-server host and letting qrerun run
normally.  The previous nodes may need manual cleaning.  
See the
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
.At Rerunable
attribute and the
.Ig
.Ar \-r 
option on the
.B qsub 
and
.B qalter
commands.
.SH  OPERANDS
The qrerun
command accepts one or more
.Ar job_identifier
operands of the form:
.br
.Ty "\ \ \ \ sequence_number[.server_name][@server]"
.br
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
See the description under "Job Identifier" in section \*(Ji in this ERS.
.Ig
.SH STANDARD ERROR
The
qrerun
command will write a diagnostic message to standard error for
each error occurrence.
.SH EXIT STATUS
Upon successful processing of all the operands presented to the
qrerun command, the exit status will be a value of zero.
.LP
If the qrerun command fails to process any operand, the
command exits with a value greater than zero.
