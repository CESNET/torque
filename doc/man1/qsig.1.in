.SH NAME
qsig \- signal pbs batch job
.SH SYNOPSIS
qsig
[\-s\ signal]
job_identifier ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B qsig
command requests that a signal be sent to executing batch jobs.
The signal is sent to the session leader of the job.
.LP
If the
.Ar \-s
option is not specified,
.B `SIGTERM' 
is sent.
The request to signal a batch job will be rejected if:
.IP \-
The user is not authorized to signal the job.
.IP \-
The job is not in the 
.B running
state.
.IP \-
The requested signal is not supported by the system upon which the
job is executing.
.LP
The qsig
command sends a 
.I "Signal Job"
batch request to the server which owns the job.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\-s signal" 15
Declares which signal is sent to the job.
.RS
.LP
The
.Ar signal
argument is either a signal name, e.g.  \fBSIGKILL\fP,
the signal name without the \fBSIG\fP prefix, e.g. \fBKILL\fP,
or a unsigned signal number, e.g. \fB9\fP.
The signal name
.B SIGNULL
is allowed; the server will send the signal 0 to the job which will
have no effect on the job, but will cause an obituary to be sent if the job is
no longer executing.
Not all signal names will be recognized by qsig. If it doesn't recognize the
signal name, try issuing the signal number instead.
.LP
Two special signal names, "suspend" and "resume", are used to suspend and
resume jobs.  Cray systems use the Cray-specific suspend()/resume() calls.
.LP
On non-Cray system, suspend causes a SIGTSTP to be sent to all processes in
job's top task, wait 5 seconds, and then send a SIGSTOP to all processes in all
tasks on all nodes in the job.  This differs from TORQUE 2.0.0 which did not
have the ability to propogate signals to sister nodes.  Resume sends a SIGCONT
to all processes in all tasks on all nodes.
.LP
When suspended, a job continues to occupy system resources but is not executing
and is not charged for walltime.  The job will be listed in the "S" state.
Manager or operator privilege is required to suspend or resume a job.
.LP
Note that interactive jobs may not resume properly because the top-level
shell will background the suspended child process.
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
.LP
If the server receives a
.I "Signal Job" 
batch request with a signal that is unsupported on the server host,
the server will reject the request.
.Ig
.RE
.SH  OPERANDS
The qsig command accepts one or more
.Ar job_identifier
operands of the form:
.DS
.Ty sequence_number[.server_name][@server]
.DE
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
See the description under "Job Identifier" in section \*(Ji in this ERS.
.Ig
.SH STANDARD ERROR
The qsig command will write a diagnostic messages to standard error for
each error occurrence.
.SH EXIT STATUS
Upon successful processing of all the operands presented to the
qsig command, the exit status will be a value of zero.
.LP
If the qsig command fails to process any operand, the
command exits with a value greater than zero.
