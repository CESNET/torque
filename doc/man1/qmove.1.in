.SH NAME
qmove \- move pbs batch job
.SH SYNOPSIS
qmove destination job_identifier ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
To move a job is to remove the job from the queue in which it 
resides and instantiate the job in another queue. 
The
.B qmove
command issues a 
.I "Move Job"
batch request to the batch server that currently owns each job specified
by
.Ar job_identifier .
.LP
A job in the
.B Running ,
.B Transiting ,
or
.B Exiting
state cannot be moved.
.SH OPERANDS
The first operand is the new
.Ar destination for the jobs.  It will be accepted in the syntax:
.br
.Ty "\ \ \ \ queue"
.br
.Ty "\ \ \ \ @server"
.br
.Ty "\ \ \ \ queue@server"
.br
See the PBS ERS section \*(Di, "Destination Identifiers".
.LP
If the 
.Ar destination
operand describes only a queue, then qmove
will move jobs into the queue of the specified name at the job's current server.
.LP
If the 
.Ar destination
operand describes only a batch server, then qmove
will move jobs into the default queue at that batch server.
.LP
If the 
.Ar destination
operand describes both a queue and a batch server, then qmove
will move the jobs into the specified queue at the specified server.
.LP
All following operands are
.Ar job_identifiers
which specify the jobs to be moved to the new
.Ar destination .
The qmove
command accepts one or more
.Ar job_identifier
operands of the form:
.br
.Ty "\ \ \ \ sequence_number[.server_name][@server]"
.br
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
See the description under "Job Identifier" in section \*(Ji in this ERS.
.Ig
.SH STANDARD ERROR
The qmove command will write a diagnostic messages to standard error for each
error occurrence.
.SH EXIT STATUS
Upon successful processing of all the operands presented to the
qmove command, the exit status will be a value of zero.
.LP
If the qmove command fails to process any operand, the
command exits with a value greater than zero.
