.SH NAME
nqs2pbs \- convert NQS job scripts to PBS
.SH SYNOPSIS
nqs2pbs nqs_script [\^pbs_script\^]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This utility converts a existing NQS job script to work with PBS and NQS.
The existing script is copied and PBS directives,
.I #PBS ,
are inserted prior to each NQS directive 
.I #QSUB 
or
.I #@$ ,
in the original script.
.LP
Certain NQS date specification and options are not supported by PBS.
A warning message will be displayed indicating the problem and the line of
the script on which it occurred.
.LP
If any unrecognizable NQS directives are encountered, an error message
is displayed.  The new PBS script will be deleted if any errors occur.
.SH OPERANDS
.IP nqs_script
Specifies the file name of the NQS script to convert.  This file is not
changed.
.IP pbs_script
If specified, it is the name of the new PBS script.   If not specified,
the new file name is
.I nqs_script.new .
.LP
.SH NOTES
Converting NQS date specifications to the PBS form may result in a warning
message and an incompleted converted date.  PBS does not support date
specifications of "today", "tomorrow", or the name of the days of the week
such as "Monday".  If any of these are encountered in a script, the PBS
specification will contain only the time portion of the NQS specification,
i.e. #PBS \-a hhmm[.ss].   It is suggested that you specify the execution
time on the qsub command line rather than in the script.
.LP
Note that PBS will interpret a time specification without a date in the
following way:
.IP \- 3
If the time specified has not yet been reached, the job will become eligible
to run at that time today.
.IP \-
If the specified time has already passed when the job is submitted, the job
will become eligible to run at that time tomorrow.
.LP
PBS does not support time zone identifiers.  All times are taken as local
time.
