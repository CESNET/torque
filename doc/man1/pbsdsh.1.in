.SH NAME
pbsdsh \- distribute task to nodes under pbs
.SH SYNOPSIS
pbsdsh [\-c copies] [\-o] [\-s] [\-u] [\-v] program [args]
.br
pbsdsh [\-n node] [\-o] [\-s] [\-u] [\-v] program [args]
.br
pbsdsh [\-h nodename] [\-o] [\-v] program [args]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Executes (spawns) a normal Unix program on one or more nodes under control of
the Portable Batch System, PBS.  Pbsdsh uses the Task Manager
API, see tm_spawn(3), to distribute the program on the allocated nodes.
.LP
When run without the \-c or the \-n option, pbsdsh will spawn the program
on all nodes allocated to the PBS job.  The spawns take place concurrently \-
all execute at (about) the same time.
.LP
Users will find the
.B PBS_TASKNUM
,
.B PBS_NODENUM
, and the
.B PBS_VNODENUM
environmental variables useful.  They contain the TM task id, the node
identifier, and the cpu (virtual node) identifier.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\-c copies"
The program is spawned on the first
.Ar Copies
nodes allocated.  This option is mutual exclusive with \-n.
.IP "\-n node"
The program is spawned on one node which is the 
.Ar node \-th
node allocted.  This option is mutual exclusive with \-c.
.IP "\-h hostname"
The program is spawned on the node specified.
.IP \-o
Capture stdout of the spawned program.  Normally stdout goes to the job's output.
.IP \-s
If this option is given, the program is run in turn on each 
node, one after the other.
.IP \-u
The program is run once on each node (unique).  This ignores the number
of allocated processers on a given node.
.IP \-v
Verbose output about error conditions and task exit status is produced.
.SH OPERANDS
The first operand,
.Ar program ,
is the program to execute.
.LP
Additional operands,
.Ar args ,
are passed as arguments to the program.
.SH STANDARD ERROR
The pbsdsh command will write a diagnostic message to standard error for
each error occurrence.
.SH EXIT STATUS
Upon successful processing of all the operands presented to the command, the
exit status will be a value of zero.
.LP
If the pbsdsh command fails to process any operand, or fails to contact the
MOM daemon on the localhost the command exits with a value greater than zero.
