.SH NAME
qhold \- hold pbs batch jobs
.SH SYNOPSIS
qhold
[\-h hold_list] [\-t array_range]
job_identifier ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
The 
.B qhold 
command requests that a server place one or more holds on
a job.  A job that has a hold is not eligible for execution.
There are three supported holds: 
.Av USER ,
.Av OTHER
(also known as operator), and
.Av SYSTEM .
.LP
A user may place a
.Av USER 
hold upon any job the user owns.
An "operator", who is a user with "operator privilege," may place ether an
.Av USER 
or an
.Av OTHER
hold on any job.  The batch administrator may place any hold on any job.
.LP
If no 
.Ar "\-h"
option is given, the
USER 
hold will be applied to the jobs described by the 
.Ar job_identifier
operand list.
.LP
If the job identified by
.Ar job_identifier
is in the
.BR queued ,
.BR held ,
or
.B waiting
states, then all that occurs is that the hold type is added to the job.
The job is then placed into
.B held
state if it resides in an execution queue.
.LP
If the job is in
.B running
state, then the following additional action is taken to interrupt the
execution of the job.
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
.SM
This is an extension to POSIX.2d.
.NL
.Ig
If checkpoint / restart is supported by the host system, requesting a hold
on a running job will (1) cause the job to be checkpointed, (2) the 
resources assigned to the job will be released, and (3) the job is
placed in the
.B held
state in the execution queue.  
.LP
If checkpoint / restart is not supported, qhold will only set the
the requested hold attribute.  This will have no effect unless the job
is rerun with the
.B qrerun 
command.
.LP
The qhold command sends a
.I "Hold Job"
batch request to the server as described in the general section.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\-h hold_list" 15
Defines the types of holds to be placed on the job.
.IP
The
.Ar hold_list
argument is a string consisting of one or more of the letters "\fBu\fP",
"\fBo\fP", or "\fBs\fP" in any combination.
The hold type associated with each letter is:
.RS
.IP "u \- " 4
.Av USER
.IP "o \- " 4
.Av OTHER
.IP "s \- " 4
.Av SYSTEM
.RE
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
.IP
Repetition of characters is permitted.
.Ig
.IP "\-t array_range" 15
The array_range argument is an integer id or a range of integers. Multiple ids
or id ranges can be combined in a comma delimted list. Examples: -t 1-100 or
-t 1,10,50-100
.IP
If an array range isn't specified, the command tries to operate on the entire
array. The command acts on the array (or specified range of the array) just as
it would on an individual job.
.LP
.SH OPERANDS
The qhold command accepts one or more
.Ar job_identifier
operands of the form:
.DS
.Ty sequence_number[.server_name][@server]
.DE
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
See the description under "Job Identifier" in section \*(Ji in this ERS.
.Ig
.LP
.SH STANDARD ERROR
The qhold command will write a diagnostic message to standard error for each
error occurrence.
.SH EXIT STATUS
Upon successful processing of all the operands presented to the
qhold command, the exit status will be a value of zero.
.LP
If the qhold command fails to process any operand, the
command exits with a value greater than zero.
