.SH NAME
qrls \- release hold on pbs batch jobs
.SH SYNOPSIS
qrls
[\-h\ hold_list] [\-t array_range]
job_identifier ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B qrls
command removes or releases holds which exist on batch jobs.
.LP
A job may have one or more types of holds which make the job
ineligible for execution.
The types of holds are
.Av USER ,
.Av OTHER ,
and
.Av SYSTEM .
The different types of holds may require
that the user issuing the qrls command have special privilege.
Typically, the owner of the job will be able to remove a
.Av USER
hold, but not an
.Av OTHER
or
.Av SYSTEM 
hold.
An Attempt to release a hold for which the user does not have the
correct privilege is an error and no holds will be released for that job.
.LP
If no
.Ar \-h
option is specified, the 
.Av USER 
hold will be released.
.LP
If the job has no
.At execution_time
pending, the job will change to the 
.B queued
state.  If an 
.At execution_time
is still pending, the job will change to the
.B waiting
state.
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
.LP
If the
.At sched_hint
attribute is set, when the job is returned to
.B queued
state, it may be given preference in selection for execution depending
on site policy.
.LP
The qrls command sends a 
.I "Release Job"
batch request to the server which owns the job.
.Ig
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\-h hold_list" 15
Defines the types of hold to be released from the jobs.
The
.Ar hold_list
option argument is a string consisting of one or more of the letters "\fBu\fP",
"\fBo\fP", an "\fBs\fP" in any combination.
The hold type associated with each letter is:
.RS
.IP "u \- " 4
.Av USER
.IP "o \- " 4
.Av OTHER
.IP "s \- " 4
.Av SYSTEM
.RE
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
.IP
Repetition of characters is permitted.
.Ig
.IP "\-t array_range" 15
The array_range argument is an integer id or a range of integers. Multiple ids
or id ranges can be combined in a comma delimted list. Examples: -t 1-100 or
-t 1,10,50-100
.IP
If an array range isn't specified, the command tries to operate on the entire
array. The command acts on the array (or specified range of the array) just as
it would on an individual job.
.LP
.SH  OPERANDS
The qrls command accepts one or more
.Ar job_identifier
operands of the form:
.br
.Ty "\ \ \ \ sequence_number[.server_name][@server]"
.br
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
See the description under "Job Identifier" in section \*(Ji in this ERS.
.Ig
.SH STANDARD ERROR
The qrls command will write a diagnostic message to standard error for
each error occurrence.
.SH EXIT STATUS
Upon successful processing of all the operands presented to the
qrls command, the exit status will be a value of zero.
.LP
If the qrls command fails to process any operand, the
command exits with a value greater than zero.
