.SH NAME
qmsg \- send message to pbs batch jobs
.SH SYNOPSIS
qmsg
[\-E] [\-O] message_string
job_identifier ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
To send a message to a job is to write a message string into one or
more output files of the job.  Typically this is done to leave an
informative message in the output of the job.
.LP
The
.B qmsg
command writes messages into the files of jobs
by sending a 
.I "Message Job"
batch request to the batch server that owns the job.
The qmsg
command does not directly write the message into the files of the job.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\-E" 15
Specifies that the message is written to the standard error of each job.
.IP "\-O" 15
Specifies that the message is written to the standard output of each job.
.LP
If neither the
.Ar \-E
nor the
.Ar \-O
option is specified, the message will be written to the standard error
of the job.
.SH  OPERANDS
The first operand,
.Ar message_string ,
is the message to be written.  If the string contains blanks, the string
must be quoted.
If the final character of the string is not a newline, a newline character
will be added when written to the job's file.
.LP
All following operands are
.Ar job_identifiers
which specify the jobs to receive the message string.
The qmsg command accepts one or more
.Ar job_identifier
operands of the form:
.br
.Ty "\ \ \ \ sequence_number[.server_name][@server]"
.br
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
See the description under "Job Identifier" in section \*(Ji in this ERS.
.Ig
.SH STANDARD ERROR
The qmsg
command will write a diagnostic message to standard error for
each error occurrence.
.SH EXIT STATUS
Upon successful processing of all the operands presented to the
qmsg
command, the exit status will be a value of zero.
.LP
If the qmsg command fails to process any operand, the
command exits with a value greater than zero.
