.SH NAME
xpbs \- GUI front end to PBS commands
.SH SYNOPSIS
xpbs [\-admin]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBxpbs\fP command provides a user-friendly point-and-click interface to
PBS commands. Please see the sections below for a tour and tutorials. Also, 
within every dialog box, a \fBHelp\fP button can be found for assistance.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\-admin" 8
A mode where additional buttons are made available for terminating PBS servers,
starting/stopping/disabling/enabling queues, and running/rerunning jobs.
.in 0
.LP
.SH GETTING STARTED
Running \fBxpbs\fP will initialize the X resource database from various sources
in the following order:
.IP "1."
The \fBRESOURCE_MANAGER\fP property on the root window (updated via xrdb) with
settings usually defined in the .Xdefaults file
.IP "2."
Preference settings defined by the system administrator in the global xpbsrc
file
.IP "3."
User's ~/.xpbsrc file \- this file defines various X resources like fonts,
colors, list
of PBS hosts to query, criteria for listing queues and jobs, and various view
states. See PREFERENCES section below for a list of resources that can be set.
.SH RUNNING XPBS
.LP
To run \fBxpbs\fP as a regular, non-privileged user, type:
.RS
.sp
.Ty "\ \ \ setenv DISPLAY <display_host>:0"
.br
.Ty "\ \ \ xpbs"
.sp
.RE
To run \fBxpbs\fP with the additional purpose of terminating PBS servers,
stopping and starting queues, or running/rerunning jobs, then run:
.RS
.sp
.Ty "\ \ \ xpbs \-admin"
.sp
.RE
NOTE: Be sure to appropriately set ~/.rhosts file if you're planning to submit
jobs to some remote server, and expecting output files to be returned to the
local host (where xpbs was run).
Usually, adding the PBS hostname running the server to your .rhosts file
locally, and adding the name of the local machine to the .rhosts file at
remote host, should be sufficient. 
.sp
Also, be sure that the PBS client commands are in the default PATH because
\fBxpbs\fP will call these commands.  
.SH THE XPBS DISPLAY
This section describes the main parts of the \fBxpbs\fP display. The main 
window is composed of 5 distinct areas (subwindows) arranged 
vertically (one on top of another) in the following order:
.RS
\ \ \ 1) Menu
.br
\ \ \ 2) Hosts
.br
\ \ \ 3) Queues
.br
\ \ \ 4) Jobs
.br
\ \ \ 5) Info
.br
.RE
.LP
\fBMenu\fP. The Menu area is composed of a row of command buttons that 
signal some action with a click of the left mouse button. The buttons 
are:
.RS
.IP "Manual Update" 23
to update the information on hosts, queues, and jobs.
.IP "Auto Update" 23
same as
.Ar "Manual Update"
except updating is done automatically every
<some specified> number of minutes.
.IP "Track Job" 23
for periodically checking for returned output files of jobs.
.IP "Preferences" 23
for setting certain parameters such as the list of server 
host(s) to query.
.IP "Help" 23
contains some help information.
.IP "About" 23
tells of the author and who to send comments, bugs, suggestions to.
.IP "Close" 23
for exiting \fBxpbs\fP plus saving the current setup information
(if anything had changed) in the user's $HOME/.xpbsrc file. Information saved include
the selected host(s), queue(s), job(s), the different jobs
listing criteria, the view states (i.e.
minimized/maximized) of the Hosts, Queues, Jobs, and INFO  regions, and
anything in the Preferences section.
.RE
.LP
\fBHosts\fP. The Hosts area is composed of a leading horizontal HOSTS bar,
a listbox, and a set of command buttons. The HOSTS bar contains a
minimize/maximize button, identified by a dot or a rectangular image,
for displaying or iconizing the Hosts region. The listbox
displays information about favorite server host(s), and each entry is
meant to be selected via a single left mouse button click, shift key +
mouse button 1 click for contiguous selection, or cntrl key + mouse
button 1 click for non-contiguous selection. The command buttons
represent actions on selected host(s), and commonly found buttons are:
.RS
.IP detail 11
for obtaining detailed information about selected server
host(s).  This functionality can also be achieved by double
clicking on an entry in the Hosts listbox.
.IP "Submit" 11 
for submitting a job to any of the queues managed by the 
selected host(s).

.LP
\fBJobs\fP. The Jobs area is composed of a leading horizontal JOBS bar,
a listbox, and a set of command buttons. The JOBS bar lists the
queues that are consulted when listing jobs; the bar also contains a
minimize/maximize button for displaying or iconizing
the Jobs region. The listbox displays information about jobs that
are found in the queue(s) selected from the Queues listbox; each
listbox entry is meant to be selected (highlighted) via a single
left mouse button click, shift key + mouse button 1 click for
contiguous selection, or cntrl key + mouse button 1 click for
non-contiguous selection. The region just above the Jobs listbox
shows a collection of command buttons whose labels describe
criteria used for filtering the Jobs listbox
contents. The list of jobs can be selected according to the
owner of jobs (Owners), job state (Job_States), name of the
job (Job_Name), type of hold placed on the job (Hold_Types),
the account name associated with the job (Account_Name),
checkpoint attribute (Checkpoint), time the job is eligible
for queueing/execution (Queue_Time), resources requested by
the job (Resources), priority attached to the job (Priority),
and whether or not the job is rerunnable (Rerunnable). The
selection criteria can be modified by clicking on any of the
appropriate command buttons to bring up a selection box. The
criteria command buttons are accompanied by a
.Ar "Select Jobs"
button, which when clicked, will update the contents of the Jobs
listbox based on the new selection criteria. Please see \fBqselect(1B)\fP
for more details on how the jobs are filtered.
.sp
Finally, to the right of the listbox, the Jobs region is accompanied

.RE
.SH WIDGETS USED IN XPBS
Some of the widgets used in \fBxpbs\fP and how they are manipulated are
described in the following:
.sp
.IP "1." 3
\fBlistbox\fP \- can be multi-selectable (a number of entries can be
selected/highlighted using a mouse click) or single-selectable (one entry
can be highlighted at a time). For a multi-selectable listbox,
the following operations are allowed:
.RS
.IP "a." 3
single click with mouse button 1 to select/highlight an
entry.
.IP "b." 3
shift key + mouse button 1 to contiguously select more
than one entry.
.IP "c." 3
cntrl key + mouse button 1 to non-contiguously select
more than one entry.
NOTE: For systems running Tk < 4.0, the newly selected
item is reshuffled to appear next to already selected
items.
.IP "d." 3
click the
.Ar "Select All/Deselect All"
button to select all
entries or deselect all entries at once.
.IP "e." 3
double clicking an entry usually activates some action
that uses the selected entry as a parameter.
.sp
.RE
.IP "2." 3
\fBscrollbar\fP \- usually appears either vertically or
horizontally and contains 5 distinct areas that are mouse
clicked to achieve different effects:
.RS
.IP "top arrow" 14
Causes the view in the associated widget to shift up
by one unit (i.e. the object appears to move down
one unit in its window). If the button is held down
the action will auto-repeat.
.IP "top gap" 14
Causes the view in the associated window to shift up
by one less than the number of units in the window
(i.e. the portion of the object that used to appear
at the very top of the window will  now  appear at
the  very bottom).  If the button is held down the
action will auto-repeat.
.IP "slider" 14
Pressing button 1 in this area has  no immediate
effect except to  cause the slider to appear  sunken
rather than raised.  However, if the mouse is moved
with the button down  then  the slider will  be
dragged, adjusting the view as the mouse is moved.
.IP "bottom gap" 14
Causes the view in the associated window to shift
down  by one less  than the number of units in the
window (i.e.  the portion of  the  object  that  used
to appear at the very bottom of the window will  now
appear  at the very top).  If the button is held down
the action  will auto-repeat.
.IP "bottom arrow" 14
Causes the view in the associated window to shift
down by one unit (i.e. the object appears to move up
one unit in its window). If the button is held down
the action will auto-repeat.
.RE
.sp
.IP "3." 3
\fBentry\fP \- brought into focus with a click of the left
mouse button.  To manipulate this widget, simply type in
the text value. Use of arrow keys, mouse selection of
text for deletion or overwrite, copying and pasting with
sole use of mouse buttons are permitted.
This widget is usually accompanied by a scrollbar for
horizontally scanning a long text entry string.
.sp
.IP "4." 3
\fBmatrix of entry boxes\fP \- usually shown as several
rows of entry widgets where a number of entries (called
fields) can be found per row. The matrix is accompanied by
up/down arrow buttons for paging through the rows of data,
and each group of fields gets one scrollbar for horizontally
scanning long entry strings.  Moving from field to field can
be done using the <Tab>, <Cntrl-f>, or <Cntrl-b> (move
backwards) keys.
.sp
.IP "5." 3
\fBspinbox\fP \- a combination of an entry widget and a
horizontal scrollbar.  The entry widget will only accept
values that fall within a defined list of valid values, and
incrementing through the valid values is done by clicking on
the up/down arrows.
.IP "6." 3
\fBbutton\fP \- a rectangular region appearing either raised or
pressed that invokes an action when clicked with the left
mouse button.  When the button appears pressed, then hitting
the <RETURN> key will automatically select the button.
.IP "7." 3
\fBtext\fP \- an editor like widget. This widget is brought
into focus with a click of the left mouse button. To manipulate
this widget, simply type in the text. Use of arrow keys,
backspace/delete key, mouse selection of text for deletion or
overwrite, copying and pasting with sole use of mouse buttons
are permitted. This widget is usually accompanied by a scrollbar
for vertically scanning a long entry.
.SH SUBMITTING JOBS
Submitting a PBS job requires only to manipulate the widgets found in the
Submit window.
The submit dialog box is composed of 4 distinct regions:
.sp
\ \ \ 1) Job Script
.br
\ \ \ 2) OPTIONS
.br
\ \ \ 3) OTHER OPTIONS
.br
\ \ \ 4) Command Buttons
.sp
The Job Script file region is at the upper left, the OPTIONS
region containing various widgets for setting job attributes
is scattered all over the dialog box, the OTHER OPTIONS is
located just below the Job Script file region, and Command
Buttons region is at the bottom.
.sp
The job script region is composed of a header box, the text
box, FILE entry box, and a couple of buttons labeled
.Ar load
and
.Ar save.
If you have a script file containing PBS options
and executable lines, then type the name of the file on the
FILE entry box, and then click on the
.Ar load
button. The
various widgets in the Submit window will get loaded with
values found in the script file. The script file text box
will only be loaded with executable lines (non-PBS) found
in the script. The job script header box has a
.Ar Prefix
entry box that can be modified to specify the PBS
directive to look for when parsing a script file for PBS
options.
If you don't have a script file, you can start typing the
executable lines of the job in the file text box.
.sp
To submit a job, perform the following steps:
.RS
.IP "1." 3
Select a host from the HOSTS listbox in the main \fBxpbs\fP
display.
.IP "2." 3
Click on the
.Ar Submit
button located in the Menu bar.
.IP "3." 3
Specify the script file containing the job execution lines and
job property values, or simply type in the execution lines in
the FILE textbox.
.IP "4." 3
Start manipulating the various widgets in the Submit window.
Particularly, pay close attention to the Destination
listbox. This box lists all the queues found in the host
that you selected. A special entry called
.Ty """@host"""
refers
to the default queue at host. Select appropriately the
destination queue of the job.  More options can be found
by clicking the OTHER OPTIONS buttons.
.IP "5." 3
At the bottom of the Submit window, click
.Ar "confirm submit".
You can also click on
.Ar "interactive"
to run the job
interactively.  Running a job interactively will open an
xterm window to your display host containing the session.
.sp
NOTE: The script FILE entry box is accompanied by a
.Ar save
button that you click to save the current widget values to
the specified file in a form that can later be read by \fBxpbs\fP
or by the \fBqsub\fP command.
.RE
.SH MODIFYING ATTRIBUTES OF JOBS
Modifying a PBS job requires only to manipulate the widgets found
in the Modify window. To modify a job or jobs, do the following
steps:

.RE
.SH TRACKING RETURNED OUTPUT FILES
If you want to be informed of returned output files of
current jobs, and be able to quickly see the
contents of those files, then enable the
.Ty """track job"""
feature as follows:
.RS
.IP "1."
Submit all the jobs that you want monitored.
.IP "2."
Click on the
.Ar "Track Job"
button located in the Menu bar to
bring up the Track Job dialog box.
.IP "3."
Specify the list of user names, whose jobs are to be
monitored for returned output files, in the matrix located
at the upper left of the dialog box.
.IP "4."
Manipulate the minutes spinbox, located just below the user
names matrix, to specify the interval value when output
files will be periodically checked.
.IP "5."
Specify the location of job output files (whether locally or
remotely) by clicking on one of the radio buttons located at
the upper right of the dialog box. Returned locally means the
output files will be returned back to the host where \fBxpbs\fP 
was run. If the output files are returned to some remote host, then
\fBxpbs\fP will execute an
.br
.Ty "\ \ \ RSH <remote_host> test \-f <output_files>"
.br
to test the existence of the files. RSH is whatever you set the remote shell
command to in the corresponding entry box.
.sp
NOTE: Be sure the files are accessible from the host where
\fBxpbs\fP was run (i.e. .rhosts appropriately set).
.IP "6."
Click
.Ar "start/reset tracking"
button located at the bottom of the dialog box to:
.RS
.IP \- 2
cancel any previous tracking
.IP \- 2
build a new list of jobs to be monitored for returned
output files based on currently queued jobs.
.IP \- 2
start periodic tracking.
.RE
.IP "7."
Click on
.Ar "close window"
button.
.RE
.sp
When an output file for a job being monitored is found, then the
.Ar "Track Job"
button (the one that originally invoked the Track Job
dialog box) will turn into a different color, and the
.Ar "Jobs Found Completed"
listbox, located in the Track Job dialog box,
is then loaded with the corresponding job id(s). Then double click
on a job id to see the contents of the output file and the error file.
Click
.Ar "stop tracking"
if you want to cancel tracking.
.SH LEAVING XPBS
Click on the Close button located in the Menu bar to leave \fBxpbs\fP.
