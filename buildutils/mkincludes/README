This directory contains files meant to be included in other
makefiles. Because some of these include files need preprocessing
by configure (thus ending up in the build tree) and others do not
(i.e. remaining in the src tree) all of the make files are preprocessed
even if no substitutions are needed. In this way they all end up in 
the build tree and can be included in a uniform way.
