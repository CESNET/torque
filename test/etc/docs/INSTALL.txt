*     Installing Moab::Test     *
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * 

===== Dependencies ====== 

Moab::Test needs the following Perl modules to function : 

  * Attribute::Curried 
  * Data::Properties 
  * IPC::Run3 
  * Proc::Daemon 
  * TAP::Harness 
  * Test::More
  * XML::LibXML 

===== Install Location =====

You will need to have Moab::Test in your Perl library path. You can set this 
value to something other than the default by defining the Perl5LIB variable 
in your .bashrc (or other config file) 

===== Configuration =====

Moab::Test looks for the file /etc/clustertest.conf for systemwide configuration
options. A sample /etc/clustertest.conf file is as follows : 

    # Pound lines are comment lines
    # This file is in the Data::Properties format
    MoabHost=Perltestdev
    Outdir=/var/log/clustertest/
    PATH=/usr/test/moab/bin:/usr/test/moab/sbin:/usr/test/torque/bin:/usr/test/torque/sbin:/usr/test/slurm/bin:/usr/test/slurm/sbin:/usr/test/bin/:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin
    data.props.loc=/tmp/clustertest.props
    source.dir=/usr/test/src/
    test.base=/usr/local/perltests/t/


Edit the file to reflect your configuration. 

source.dir -- all source code can be downloaded to a common directory
test.base -- the location of the `t' folder where tests are located
data.props.loc -- the location of test specific Data::Properties files
Outdir -- the directory where timestamped directories will be created to store test results

===== About data.props.loc (/tmp/clustertest.props) =====

In order to be able to use the same test with different configurations, Moab::Test
uses Data::Properties files to store test variables. Nearly every test will require 
that the appropriate Data::Properties file be present at the location specified 
by the global data.props.loc variable. In my case, I copy the appropriate file 
from the perltests/lib directory to /tmp/clustertest.conf, then run the test. 

You may need to edit the Data::Properties files in the perltests/lib directory
to reflect the paths used on your system. While this is inconvenient, it is
better than needing ot edit each test.

When writing tests, please do not use hard coded paths, please use parameters
in Data::Properties files.

*     Installing browse-log	*
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * 

browse-log is a program which makes it easy to browse the results of tests. It
is the most usefull when you have many tests, particularly if they are nested.

browse-log is in the perltests/bin directory. You can either edit your PATH
variable to reflect this location, or you can copy browse-log to a directory
in your path. 

browse-log requires Moab::Test::Reader to be in the Perl path.

The last-log program will run browse-log on the last test which was run. 
Last-log requires that browse-log be in the PATH.
