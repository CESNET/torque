        <h3>Torque - MetaCentrum fork</h3>

<p>This project is a fork of the Torque Batch System, currently maintained by <a href="http://www.adaptivecomputing.com/products/open-source/torque">Adaptive Computing</a>.</p>

<p>This repository is maintained by <a href="http://ces.net">CESNET</a>, the Czech NREN maintainer. Specifically this repository is managed by <a href="http://www.metacentrum.cz/en/index.html">MetaCentrum</a>, the group responsible for the Czech National Grid Infrastructure, that is encompassing some 280 computational nodes spread across the Czech Republic.</p>

<p>The version published in the master branch of this repository is representing the current stable version deployed in this grid.</p>

<h2>Features in this fork</h2>

<p>This fork is based on the 2.4 branch in the Torque release cycle, and is planned to be synchronized with version 3.0. We are considering Torque 4.0, but many architectural changes in this version are making our features very hard to port.</p>

<p>This fork contains a full rewrite of the FIFO C scheduler, targeted towards distributed environments with strict resource semantics and heavy support for virtualization.</p>

<p>Other components are widely extended to support many features, from already mentioned virtualization, strong resource semantics (processor, memory, GPU cards), Kerberos authentication and many other.</p>

<p>Apart from new features this fork also includes countless fixes.</p>

<h3>How to get it</h3>

<p>You can either download the last stable version from the top of the page, or you can fetch the git repository from github.</p>

<pre><code>$ git clone git://github.com/CESNET/torque.git
</code></pre>

<h2>Building and packaging</h2>

<p>Because the changes have many external dependencies, the build is a bit complicated.</p>

<p>While this version can be compiled without Kerberos support, if you want it, you need to acquire our patched version of Heimdal Kerberos.</p>

<p>Second independent piece of software is <code>pbs_cache</code>. This software is used for tracking and storing mostly very dynamic resources, or other node properties that can be presented in the form of <code>key-&gt;value</code> mapping.</p>

<p>This software is present in the repository in the <code>magrathea/pbs_cache</code> directory and can be easily compiled and installed.</p>

<h1>Compilation and options</h1>

<p>Torque is managed using the automake build system. To compile it, you need to use the following commands:</p>

<pre><code>autoreconf -ivf
mkdir _build_ ; pushd _build_
CFLAGS="-std=gnu99 -D_GNU_SOURCE" CXXFLAGS="-std=c++0x -D_GNU_SOURCE" ../configure --with-rcp=scp --with-sched=c --with-sched-code=world --with-gssapi --enable-torque-ports --prefix=/usr --mandir=/usr/share/man --infodir=/usr/share/info --with-sendmail=/usr/sbin/sendmail --with-default-server=arien.ics.muni.cz --enable-syslog  --enable-silent-rules
make
</code></pre>

<h1>Debian packages</h1>

<p>If you are interested in Debian packages, please feel free to contact us. While we don't include the scripts and scaffolding for Debian packaging in the repository, we are open to sharing them. </p>
