c - crash     b - bug fix    e - enhancement    f - new feature  n - note

3.0.4
  c - fix a buffer being overrun with nvidia gpus enabled
  b - no longer leave zombie processes when munge authenticating.
  b - no longer reject procs if it is the second argument to -l
  b - when having pbs_mom re-read the config file, old servers were kept, and pbs_mom
      attempted to communicate with those as well. Now they are cleared and only the 
      new server(s) are contacted.
  b - pbsnodes -l can now search on all valid node states
  e - Added functionality that allows the values for the server parameter
      authorized_users to use wild cards for both the user and host portion.
  e - Improvements in munge handling of client connections and authentication.
  b - block SIGCHLD while reading the munge file to avoid false errors.

3.0.3
  b - fix for bugzilla #141 - qsub was overwriting the path variable in PBSD_authenticate
  e - automatically create and mount /dev/cpuset when TORQUE is configured but the cpuset
      directory isn't there
  b - fix a bug where node lines past 256 characters were rejected. This buffer has been
      made much larger (8192 characters)
  b - clear out exec_gpus as needed
  b - fix for bugzilla #147 - recreate $PBS_NODESFILE file when restarting a blcr
      checkpointed job
  b - Fixed kill_job so it will only run epilogue.precancel when a job is canceled
      and not on normal job exit.
  b - Applied patch submitted by Eric Roman for resmom/Makefile.am (Bugzilla #147)
  b - Fix for adding -lcr for BLCR makefiles (Bugzilla #146)
  c - fix a potential segfault when using asynchronous runjob with an array slot limit
  b - fix bugzilla #135, stagein was deleting directory instead of file
  b - fix bugzilla #133, qsub submit filter, the -W arguments are not all there
  e - add a mom config option - $attempt_to_make_dir - to give the user the option to 
      have TORQUE attempt to create the directories for their output file if they don't exist
  c - check if the pid list in mom_get_sample is NULL before freeing 
      (only happens with cpusets enabled)
  b - Fixed a problem where pbs_server would seg-fault if munge was not running or
      if an invalid credential were passed to unmunge
  e - Change to allow qsub -l ncpus=x:gpus=x which adds a resource list entry for both
  b - fix so user epilogues are run as user instead of root
  b - fix the prevent pbs_server from hanging when doing server to server job moves.
  b - No longer report a completion code if a job is pre-empted using qrerun. 
  c - In some rare cases, TORQUE loads a job with no groups. Do not crash in this case.
  b - Merged revision 5236 from 2.5-fixes. To accommodate this fix I had to modify the 
      signature of job_recov to add a momport so job_recov could properly write to job_save.
  c - Fix a crash in record_jobinfo() - this is fixed by backporting dynamic strings from
      4.0.0 so that all of the resizing is done in a central location, fixing the crash.
  b - Fixed a problem in qsub where you could not submit a job in interactive mode with 
      gpus in the resource list.
  b - Initialized PBSNodeCheckInterval to 1. This set the default value for node_check_interval.
  b - No longer count down walltime for jobs that are suspending or have stopped running 
      for any other reasons
  b - Fixed qsub so it would still allow -l gpus=x as a gres.
  c - fix a crash in the dynamic_string.c code
  e - add a mom config option - $ext_pwd_retry - to specify # of retries on 
      checking for password validity.

3.0.2
  c - check if the file pointer to /dev/console can be opened. If not, don't attempt to write it
  b - fix a potential buffer overflow security issue in job names and host address names
  b - restore += functionality for nodes when using qmgr. It was overwriting old properties
  e - Merged revision 4711 from 2.5-fixes. This adds the -F option to qsub which allows
      arguments to be passed to a job script.
  b - fix bugzilla #134, qmgr -= was deleting all entries
  e - added the ability in qsub to submit jobs requesting total gpus for job instead of gpus per node:
      -l ncpus=X,gpus=Y
  b - do not prepend ${HOME} with the current dir for -o and -e in qsub
  e - allow an administator using the proxy user submission to also set the job id to be used 
      in TORQUE. This makes TORQUE easier to use in grid configurations.
  b - fix jobs named with -J not always having the server name appended correctly 
  b - make it so that jobs named like arrays via -J have legal output and error file names
  b - make a fix for ATTR_node_exclusive - qsub wasn't accepting -n as a valid argument

3.0.1
  e - updated qsub's man page to include ATTR_node_exclusive
  b - when updating the nodes file, write out the ports for the mom if needed 
  b - fix a bug for non-NUMA systems that was continuously increasing memory values
  e - the queue files are now stored as XML, just like the serverdb
  e - Added code from 2.5-fixes which will try and find nodes that did not
      resolve when pbs_server started up. This is in reference to Bugzilla
      bug 110.
  e - make gpus compatible with NUMA systems, and add the node attribute
      numa_gpu_node_str for an additional way to specify gpus on node boards
  e - Add code to verify the group list as well when VALIDATEGROUPS is set in torque.cfg
  b - Fix a bug where if geometry requests are enabled and cpusets are enabled, the cpuset
      wasn't deleted unless a geometry request was made. 
  b - Fix a race condition for pbs_mom -q, exitstatus was getting overwritten and as a result 
      pbs_server wasn't always re-queued, but were being deleted instead. 
  e - Add a configure option --with-tcp-retry-limit to prevent potential 4+ hour hangs on 
      pbs_server. We recommend --with-tcp-retry-limit=2
  n - Changing the way to set ATTR_node_exclusive from -E to -n, in order to continue 
      compatibility with Moab.
  b - preserve the order on array strings in TORQUE, like the route_destinations for a 
      routing queue 
  b - fix bugzilla #111, multi-line environment variables causing errors in TORQUE.
  b - allow apostrophes in Mail_Users attributes, as apostrophes are rare but legal email
      characters 
  b - restored functionality for -W umask as reported in bugzilla 115
  b - Updated torque.spec.in to be able to handle the snapshot names of builds.
  b - fix pbs_mom -q to work with parallel jobs
  b - Added code to free the mom.lock file during MOM shutdown.
  e - Added new MOM configure option job_starter. This options will execute
      the script submitted in qsub to the executable or script provided
  b - fixed a bug in set_resources that prevented the last resource in a list from being
      checked. As a result the last item in the list would always be added
      without regard to previous entries.
  e - altered the prologue/epilogue code to allow root squashing
  f - added the mom config parameter $reduce_prolog_checks. This makes it so TORQUE only checks
      to verify that the file is a regular file and is executable.
  e - allow more than 5 concurrent connections to TORQUE using pbsD_connect. Increase it to 10
  b - fix a segfault when receiving an obit for a job that no longer exists
  e - Added options to conditionally build munge, BLCR, high-availability, cpusets,
      and spooling. Also allows customization of the sendmail path.
  b - expand the storage for memory usage to avoid overflow
  b - also remove the procct resource when it is applied because of a default
  f - Added the ability to detect Nvidia gpus using nvidia-smi (default) or NVML.
      Server receives gpu statuses from pbs_mom. Added server attribute auto_node_gpu
      that allows automatically setting number of gpus for nodes based on gpu
      statuses. Added new configure options --enable-nvidia-gpus,
      --with-nvml-include and --with-nvml-lib.  
  c - fix a segfault when using --enable-nvidia-gpus and pbs_mom has Nvidia driver
      older than 260 that still has nvidia-smi command
  e - Added capability to automatically set mode on Nvidia gpus. Added support for
      gpu reseterr option on qsub. The nodes file will be updated with Nvidia gpu
      count when --enable-nvidia-gpu configure option is used. Moved some code
      out of job_purge_thread to prevent segfault on mom.

3.0.0
  e - serverdb is now stored as xml, this is no longer configurable.
  f - added --enable-numa-support for supporting NUMA-type architectures. We
      have tested this build on UV and Altix machines. The server treats the
      mom as a node with several special numa nodes embedded, and the pbs_mom
      reports on these numa nodes instead of itself as a whole.
  f - for numa configurations, pbs_mom creates cpusets for memory as well as
      cpus
  e - adapted the task manager interface to interact properly with NUMA 
      systems, including tm_adopt
  e - Addeded autogen.sh go make life easier in a Makefile.in-less world.
  e - Modified buildutils/pbs_mkdirs.in to create server_priv/nodes file
      at install time. The file only shows examples and a link to the
      TORQUE documentation.
  f - added ATTR_node_exclusive to allow a job to have a node exclusively. 
  f - added --enable-memacct to use an extra protocol in order to 
      accurately track jobs that exceed over their memory limits and kill 
      them 
  e - when ATTR_node_exclusive is set, reserve the entire node (or entire
      numa node if applicable) in the cpuset 
  n - Changed the protocol versions for all client-to-server, mom-to-server and
      mom-to-mom protocols from 1 to 2. The changes to the protocol in this version
      of TORQUE will make it incompatible with previous versions.
  e - when a select statement is used, tally up the memory requests and mark
      the total in the resource list. This allows memory enforcement for
      NUMA jobs, but doesn't affect others as memory isn't enforced for 
      multinode jobs
  e - add an asynchronous option to qdel 
  b - do not reply when an asynchronous reply has already been sent
  e - make the mem, vmem, and cput usage available on a per-mom basis using momctl -d2
      (Dr. Bernd Kallies)
  e - move the memory monitor functionality to linux/mom_mach.c in order to store the 
      more accurate statistics for usage, and still use it for applying limits.
      (Dr. Bernd Kallies)
  e - when pbs_mom is compiled to use cpusets, instead of looking at all processes, 
      only examine the ones in cpuset task files. For busy machines (especially large
      systems like UVs) this can exponentially reduce job monitoring/harvesting times.
      (Dr. Bernd Kallies)
  e - when cpusets are configured and memory pressure enabled, add the ability to 
      check memory pressure for a job. Using $memory_pressure_threshold and 
      $memory_pressure_duration in the mom's config, the admin sets a threshold at 
      which a job becomes a problem. If duration is set, the job will be killed if
      it exceeds the threshold for the configured number of checks. If duration isn't 
      set, then an arror is logged.
      (Dr. Bernd Kallies)
  e - change pbs_track to look for the executable in the existing path so it doesn't always
      need a complete path.
      (Dr. Bernd Kallies)
  e - report sessions on a per numa node basis when NUMA is enabled
      (Dr. Bernd Kallies)
  b - Merged revision 4325 from 2.5-fixes. Fixed a problem where the -m n 
      (request no mail on qsub) was not always being recongnized.
  e - Merged buildutils/torque.spec.in from 2.4-fixes. 
      Refactored torque spec file to comply with established RPM best
      practices, including the following:
        - Standard installation locations based on RPM macro configuration
          (e.g., %{_prefix})
        - Latest upstream RPM conditional build semantics with fallbacks for
          older versions of RPM (e.g., RHEL4)
        - Initial set of optional features (GUI, PAM, syslog, SCP) with more
          planned
        - Basic working configuration automatically generated at install-time
        - Reduce the number of unnecessary subpackages by consolidating where
          it makes sense and using existing RPM features (e.g., --excludedocs).
  c - fix a segfault when queue has acl_group_enable and acl_group_sloppy set
      true and no acl_groups are defined.

2.5.10 
  b - Fixed a problem where pbs_mom will crash of check_pwd returns NULL. This could
      happen for example if LDAP was down and getpwnam returns NULL.
  b - Removed a check for Interactive jobs in qsub and the -l flag. This check
      appeared to be code that was never completed and it prevented the passing
      of resource arguments.
  e - Added code to delete a job on the MOM if a job is in the EXITED substate and 
      going through the scan_for_exiting code. This happens when an obit has been
      sent and the obit reply received by the PBS_BATCH_DeleteJob has not been 
      received from the server on the MOM. This fix allows the MOM to delete the
      job and free up resources even if the server for some reason does not send 
      the delete job request.
  b - TRQ-608: Removed code to check for blocking mode in write_nonblocking_socket().
      Fixes problem with interactive jobs (qsub -I) exiting prematurely.
  c - fix a buffer being overrun with nvidia gpus enabled (backported from 3.0.4)
  b - To fix a problem in 2.5.9 where the job_array structure was modified
      without changing the version or creating an upgrade path. This made
      it incompatible with previous versions of TORQUE 2.5 and 3.0.
      Added new array structure job_array_259. This is the original torque
      2.5.9 job_array structure with the num_purged element added in the middle
      of the structure. job_array_259 was created so users could upgrade from 2.5.9
      and 3.0.3 to later versions of TORQUE. The job_array structure was
      modified by moving the num_purged element to the bottom of the structure. 
      pbsd_init now has an upgrade path for job arrays from version 3 to version
      4. However, there is an exceptional case when upgrading from 2.5.9 or 3.0.3
      where pbs_server must be started using a new -u option.


2.5.9
  e - change mom to only log "cannot find nvidia-smi in PATH" once when built
      with --enable-nvidia-gpus and running on a node that does not have Nvidia
      drivers installed.
  b - Change so gpu states get set/unset correctly. Fixes problems with multiple
      exclusive jobs being assigned to same gpu and where next job gets rejected
      because gpu state was not reset after last shared gpu job finished.
  e - Added a 1 millisecond sleep to src/lib/Libnet/net_client.c client_to_svr() 
      if connect fails with EADDRINTUSE EINVAL or EADDRNOTAVAIL case. For these cases
      TORQUE will retry the connect again. This fix increases the chance of success
      on the next iteration.
  b - Changes to decrease some gpu error messages and to detect unusual gpu
      drivers and configurations.
  b - Change so user cannot impersonate a different user when using munge.
  e - Added new option to torque.cfg name TRQ_IFNAME. This allows the user to designate
      a preferred outbound interface for TORQUE requests. The interface is the name 
      of the NIC interface, for example eth0.
  b - Fixed a problem in Munge where file descriptors were getting left open after failure
      cases and the munge process.
  e - Added instructions concerning the server parameter moab_array_compatible to the 
      README.array_changes file.
  e - Added a new function DIS_tcp_close to the the code. This takes care of a problem
      where TORQUE memory keeps growing because the read and write buffers associated
      with each tcparray entry would grow to accommodate incoming and outgoing data
      but would not shrink.
  b - Replaced call to getpwnam_ext in pam_pbssimpleauth.c with getpwnam.  
  b - Fixed a problem where jobs dependent on an array using afteranyarray would not start
      when a job element of the array completed.
  b - Fixed a bug where array jobs .AZ file would not be deleted when the array job was done.
  b - Fixed a problem where pbs_server would seg-fault if munged was not running. It would
      also seg-fault if an invalid credential were sent from a client. The seg-fault was
      occurred in the same place for both cases.
  b - Fixed a problem where array jobs would always lose their state when pbs_server was
      restarted. Array jobs now retain their previous state between restarts of the server
      the same as non-array jobs. This fix takes care of a problem where Moab and TORQUE
      would get out of sync on jobs because of this discrepency between states.
  b - Made a fix related to procct. If no resources are requested on the qsub line previous 
      versions of TORQUE did not create a Resource_List attribute. Specifically a node and
      nodect element for Resource_List. Adding this broke some applications. I made it so
      if no nodes or procs resources are requested the procct is set to 1 without creating 
      the nodes element.
  e - Changed enable-job-create to with-job-create with an optional CFLAG argument.
      --with-job-create=<CFLAG options>
  e - Changed qstat.c to display 6 instead of 5 digits for Req'd Memory for a qstat -a.

2.5.8
  e - added util function getpwnam_ext() that has retry and errno logging
      capability for calls to getpwnam().
  c - fix a potential segfault when using asynchronous runjob with an array slot limit
      (backported from 3.0.3)
  b - In pbs_original_connect() only the first NCONNECT entries of the connection table 
      were checked for availability. NCONNECT is defined as 10. However, the connection
      table is PBS_NET_MAX_CONNECTIONS in size. PBS_NET_MAX_CONNECTIONS is 10240. 
      NCONNECT is now defined as PBS_NET_MAX_CONNECTIONS.
  b - fix bugzilla #135, stagein was deleting directory instead of file (backported
      from 3.0.3)
	b - If the resources nodes or procs are not submitted on the qsub command line then
	    the nodes attribute does not get set. This causes a problem if procct is set on
			queues because there is no proc count available to evaluate. This fix sets
			a default nodes value of 1 if the nodes or procs resources are not requested.
  b - Made a fix with procct where initialize_procct was not properly accounting for 
      a "procs" resources.
  e - Modified default_router() to set the svr_do_schedule flag to SCH_SCHEDULE_NEW if
      a job was successfully routed to a queue. This helps reduce delays in running
      jobs when they are promoted from a routing queue to an execution queue.
  b - Made a fix with procct where initialize_procct was not properly accounting for 
      a "procs" resources.
  e - Modified default_router() to set the svr_do_schedule flag to SCH_SCHEDULE_NEW if
      a job was successfully routed to a queue. This helps reduce delays in running
      jobs when they are promoted from a routing queue to an execution queue.
  b - Made a fix with procct where initialize_procct was not properly accounting for 
      a "procs" resources.
  e - Modified default_router() to set the svr_do_schedule flag to SCH_SCHEDULE_NEW if
      a job was successfully routed to a queue. This helps reduce delays in running
      jobs when they are promoted from a routing queue to an execution queue.
  e - Modified pbs_disconnect so it no longer does a read to wait for the server
      side to disconnect first. Also modified write_nonblocking_socket to ensure 
      socket is non-blocking and exit if stuck on EAGAIN return from write.
  b - In pbs_original_connect() only the first NCONNECT entries of the connection table 
      were checked for availability. NCONNECT is defined as 10. However, the connection
      table is PBS_NET_MAX_CONNECTIONS in size. PBS_NET_MAX_CONNECTIONS is 10240. 
      NCONNECT is now defined as PBS_NET_MAX_CONNECTIONS.
  e - I added a new PBSE_ error code PBSE_READ_REPLY_TIMEOUT. This new error code
      replaces PBSE_EXPIRED in the function PBSD_queuejob. PBSE_EXPIRED is intended
      to be used for an expired credential and the error in PBSD_queuejob occurs
      because the select waiting for a read on a tcp socket has timed out.
  e - I added a new PBSE_ error code PBSE_READ_REPLY_TIMEOUT. This new error code
      replaces PBSE_EXPIRED in the function PBSD_queuejob. PBSE_EXPIRED is intended
      to be used for an expired credential and the error in PBSD_queuejob occurs
      because the select waiting for a read on a tcp socket has timed out.
  e - add a mom config option - $attempt_to_make_dir - to give the user the option to
      have TORQUE attempt to create the directories for their output file if they don't exist
      (backported from 3.0.3
  b - Changed configure to show --enable-gcc-warnings as an option as opposed to
      --disable-gcc-warnings. --disable-gcc-warnings is currently the default configuration.
      This fixes bug 154 of Bugzilla
  eb- NVIDIA gpu mode settings were getting lost when using Moab. Made a change to
      assign_hosts() to use the neednodes resource if gpus are present in the given spec.
      Also changed shared mode for gpus to default to reflect NVIDIA's naming scheme.
  b - Added _GNU_SOURCE as a definition in configure.ac  when compiling with
      --enable-unixsockets to enable the CMSG macros to work.
  e - Change so Nvidia drivers 260, 270 and above are recognized.
  e - Added server attribute no_mail_force which when set True eliminates all
      e-mail when job mail_points is set to "n"

2.5.7
  e - Added new qsub argument -F. This argument takes a quoted string as
      an argument. The string is a list of space separated commandline
      arguments which are available to the job script.
  b - Fixed a potential buffer overflow problem in src/resmom/checkpoint.c function
      mom_checkpoint_recover. I modified the code to change strcpy and strcat to strncpy
      and strncpy.
  b - Fixed a bug for high availability. The -l listener option for pbs_server was not
      complete and did not allow pbs_server to properly communicate with the scheduler.
      Also fixed a bug with job dependencies where the second server or later in the
      $TORQUE_HOME/server_name directory was not added as part of the job dependecny
      so dependent jobs would get stuck on hold if the current server was not the first 
      server in the server_name file.

2.5.6
  b - Made changes to record_jobinfo and supporting functions to be
      able to use dynamically allcated buffers for data. This fixed
      a problem where incoming data overran fixed sized buffers.
  b - Updated torque.spec.in to be able to handle the snapshot
      names of builds.
  e - Added new MOM configure option job_starter. This options will execute
      the script submitted in qsub to the executable or script provided
      as the argument to the job_starter option of the MOM configure file.
  b - fixed a problem with pbs_server high availability where the current 
      server could not keep the HA lock. The problem was a result of truncating
      the directory name where the lock file was kept. TORQUE would fail to 
      validate permissions because it would do a stat on the wrong directory.
  b - Added code to free the mom.lock file during MOM shutdown.
  b - fixed a bug in set_resources that prevented the last resource in a list from being
      checked. As a result the last item in the list would always be added
      without regard to previous entries.
  e - Added new symbol JOB_EXEC_OVERLIMIT. When a job exceeds a limit (i.e. walltime) the
      job will fail with the JOB_EXEC_OVERLIMIT value and
      also produce an abort case for mailing purposes. Previous to this change
      a job exceeding a limit returned 0 on success and no mail
      was sent to the user if requested on abort.
  e - Added options to buildutils/torque.spec.in to conditionally build munge, BLCR, 
      high-availability, cpusets, and spooling. Also allows customization of the
      sendmail path and allows for optional XML conversion to serverdb.
  b - --with-tcp-retry-limit now actually changes things without needing to run autoheader
  b - Fixed a problem with minimum sizes in queues. Minimum sizes were not getting enforced because
      the logic checking the queue against the user request used and && when it need a || in the 
      comparison.
  e - The -e and -o options of qsub allow a user to specify a path or optionally a filename for output. 
      If the path given by the user ended with a directory name but no '/' character at the end then
      TORQUE was confused and would not convert the .OU or .ER file to the final output/error file. The
      code has now been changed to stat the path to see if the end path element is a path or directory
      and handled appropriately.
  e - Added new MOM configuration option $rpp_throttle. The syntax for this in the 
      $TORQUE_HOME/mom_priv/config file is $rpp_throttle <value> where value is a long
      representing microseconds. Setting this values causes rpp data to pause after every
      sendto for <value> microseconds. This may help with large jobs where full data does
      not arrive at sister nodes.
  c - check if the file pointer to /dev/console can be opened. If not, don't attempt to write it
      (backported from 3.0.2)
  b - Added patch from Michael Jennings to buildutils/torque.spec.in. This patch
      allows an rpm configured with DRMAA to complete even if all of the
      support files are not present on the system.
  b - commited patch submitted by Michael Jennings to fix bug 130. TORQUE on the MOM would call
      lstat as root when it should call it as user in open_std_file.
  b - Fixed problem where calling qstat with a non-existent job id would hang the qstat
      command. This was only a problem when configured with MUNGE.
  b - fix a potential buffer overflow security issue in job names and host address names
  e - Applied patch submitted by Eric Roman. This patch addresses some build issues
      with BLCR, and fixes an error where BLCR would report -ENOSUPPORT when trying
      to checkpoint a parallel job. The patch adds a --with-blcr option to configure
      to find the path to the BLCR libaries.  There are --with-blcr-include,
      --with-blcr-lib and --with-blcr-bin to override the search paths, if necessary.
      The last option, --with-blcr-bin is used to generate contrib/blcr/checkpoint_script
      and contrib/blcr/restart_script from the information supplied at configure time.


2.5.5
  b - change so gpus get written back to nodes file
  e - make it so that even if an array request has multiple consecutive '%' the slot 
      limit will be set correctly
  b - Fixed bug in job_log_open where the global variable logpath was freed instead 
      of joblogpath.
  b - Fixed memory leak in function procs_requested.
  b - Validated incoming data for escape_xml to prevent a seg-fault with incoming
      null pointers
  e - Added submit_host and init_work_dir as job attributes. These two
      values are now displayed with a qstat -f. The submit_host is
      the name of the host from where the job was submitted. init_work_dir
      is the working directory as in PBS_O_WORKDIR.
  e - change so blcr checkpoint jobs can restart on different node. Use
      configure --enable-blcr to allow.
  b - remove the use of a GNU specific function, and fix an error for solaris builds
  b - Updated PBS_License.txt to remove the implication that the software
      is not freely redistributable. 
  b - remove the $PBS_GPUFILE when job is done on mom
  b - fix a race condition when issuing a qrerun followed by a qdel that caused 
      the job to be queued instead of deleted sometimes.
  e - Implemented Bugzilla Bug 110. If a host in the nodes file cannot be resolved
      at startup the server will try once every 5 minutes until the node 
      will resolve and it will add it to the nodes list.
  e - Added a "create" method to pbs_server init.d script so a serverdb file
      can be created if it does not exist at startup time. This is an enhancement
      in reference to Bugzilla bug 90.
  b - Fixed a problem in parse_node_token where the local static variable pt would be advanced
      past the end of the line input if there is no newline character at the end of the nodes 
      file.
  e - To fix Bugzilla Bug 121 I created a thread in job_purge on the mom in the file src/resmom/job_func.c
      All job purging now happens on its own thread. If any of the system calls fail to return
      the thread will hang but the MOM will still be able to process work.


2.5.4
  f - added the ability to track gpus. Users set gpus=X in the nodes file for
      relevant node, and then request gpus in the nodes request: 
      -l nodes=X[:ppn=Y][:gpus=Z]. The gpus appear in $PBS_GPUFILE, a new 
      environment variable, in the form: <hostname>-gpu<index> and in a 
      new job attribute exec_gpus: 
      <hostname>-gpu/<index>[+<hostname>-gpu/<index>...]
  b - clean up job mom checkpoint directory on checkpoint failure
  e - Bugzilla bug 91. Check the status before the service is actually started.
      (Steve Traylen - CERN)
  e - Bugzilla bug 89. Only touch lock/subsys files if service actually starts.
      (Steve Traylen - CERN)
  c - when using job_force_cancel_time, fix a crash in rare cases
  e - add server parameter moab_array_compatible. When set to true, this parameter
      places a limit hold on jobs past the slot limit. Once one of the unheld jobs 
      completes or is deleted, one of the held jobs is freed.
  b - fix a potential memory corruption for walltime remaining for jobs
      (Vikentsi Lapa)
  e - check if a process still exists before killing it and sleeping. This speeds up
      the time for killing a task exponentially, although this will show mostly for
      SMP/NUMA systems, but it will help everywhere.
      (Dr. Bernd Kallies)

2.5.3
  b - stop reporting errors on success when modifying array ranges
  b - don't try to set the user id multiple times
  b - added some retrying to get connection and changed some log messages when
      doing a pbs_alterjob after a checkpoint
  c - fix segfault in tracejob. It wasn't malloc'ing space for the null 
      terminator
  e - add the variables PBS_NUM_NODES and PBS_NUM_PPN to the job environment
      (TRQ-6)
  e - be able to append to the job's variable_list through the API 
      (TRQ-5)
  e - Added support for munge authentication. This is an alternative for the 
      default ruserok remote authentication and pbs_iff. This is a compile
      time option. The configure option to use is --enable-munge-auth.
      Ken Nielson (TRQ-7) September 15, 2010.
  b - fix the dependency hold for arrays. They were accidentally cleared 
      before (RT 8593)
  e - add a logging statement if sendto fails at any points in rpp_send_out
  b - Applied patch submitted by Will Nolan to fix bug 76. 
      "blocking read does not time out using signal handler"
  b - fix a bug in the $spool_as_final_name code if HAVE_WORDEXP is 
      undefined
  b - Bugzilla bug 84. Security bug on the way checkpoint is being handled.
      (Robin R. - Miami Univ. of Ohio)
  e - Now saving serverdb as an xml file instead of a byte-dump, thus 
      allowing canned installations without qmgr scripts, as well as more
      portability. Able to upgrade automatically from 2.1, 2.3, and 2.4
  b - make the tcp reading buffer able to grow dynamically to read larger 
      values in order to avoid "invalid protocol" messages 
  b - could not set the server HA parameters lock_file_update_time and 
      lock_file_check_time previously. Fixed.
  e - qpeek now has the options --ssh, --rsh, --spool, --host, -o, and 
      -e. Can now output both the STDOUT and STDERR files.  Eliminated 
      numlines, which didn't work.
  b - fix to cleanup job files on mom after a BLCR job is checkpointed and held
  b - fix so checkpoint files are transferred as the user, not as root.
  f - Added configure option --with-servchkptdir which allows specifying path
      for server's checkpoint files
  b - fix to prevent a possible segfault when using checkpointing.
  e - Added the server parameters job_log_file_max_size, job_log_file_roll_depth and
      job_log_keep_days to help manage job log files.
  e - Created the ability to log all jobs to a file. The new file is located
      under $TORQUE_HOME/job_logs. The file follows the same naming format
      as server_logs and mom_logs. The name is derived from the current date.
      This log file is optional. It can be activated using a new server
      parameter record_job_info. By default this is false. If set to true it
      will begin recording every job record when the job is purged.

      will begin recording every job record when the job is purged.
  
2.5.2
  e - Allow the nodes file to use the syntax node[0-100] in the name to 
      create identical nodes with names node0, node1, ..., node100.
      (also node[000-100] => node000, node001, ... node100)
  b - fix support of the 'procs' functionality for qsub.
  b - remove square brackets [] from job and default stdout/stderr filenames 
      for job arrays (fixes conflict with some non-bash shells)
  n - fix build system so README.array_changes is included in tar.gz file made
      with "make dist"
  n - fix build system so contrib/pbsweb-lite-0.95.tar.gz, contrib/qpool.gz
      and contrib/README.pbstools are included the the tar.gz file made
      with "make dist"
  c - fixed crash when moving the job to a different queue (bugzilla 73)
  e - Modified buildutils/pbs_mkdirs.in to create server_priv/nodes file
      at install time. The file only shows examples and a link to the
      TORQUE documentation. This enhancement was first committed to trunk.
  c - fix pbs_server crash from invalid qsub -t argument
  b - fix so blcr checkpoint jobs work correctly when put on hold
  b - fixed bugzilla #75 where pbs_server would segfault with a double free when
      calling qalter on a running job or job array.
  e - Changed free_br back to its original form and modifed copy_batchrequest
      to make a copy of the rq_extend element which will be freed in 
      free_br.
  b - fix condition where job array "template" may not get cleaned up properly 
      after a server restart
  b - fix to get new pagg ID and add additional CSA records when restarting from
      checkpoint
  e - added documentation for pbs_alterjob_async(), pbs_checkpointjob(),
      pbs_fbserver(), pbs_get_server_list() and pbs_sigjobasync().
  b - Commited patch from Eygene Ryanbinkin to fix bug 61. /dev/null would
      under some circumstances have its permissions modified when jobs exited
      on a compute node.
  e - add --enable-top-tempdir-only to only create the top directory of the 
      job's temporary directory when configured
  b - make the code for reconnecting to the server more robust, and remove
      elements of not connecting if a job isn't running
  e - allow input of walltime in the format of [DD]:HH:MM:SS
  b - Fix so BLCR checkpoint files get copied to server on qchkpt and periodic
      checkpoints
  c - corrected a segfault when display_job_server_suffix is set to false
      and job_suffix_alias was unset.

2.5.1
  b - modified Makefile.in and Makefile.am at root to include contrib/AddPrivileges

2.5.0

  e - Added new server config option alias_server_name. This option allows
      the MOM to add an additional server name to be added to the list
      of trusted addresses. The point of this is to be able to handle
      alias ip addresses. UDP requests that come into an aliased ip address
      are returned through the primary ip address in TORQUE. Because
      the address of the reply packet from the server is not the same address
      the MOM sent its HELLO1 request, the MOM drops the packet and the MOM
      cannot be added to the server.
  n - auto_node_np will now adjust np values down as well as up.
  e - Enabled TORQUE to be able to parse the -l procs=x node spec. Previously
      TORQUE simply recored the value of x for procs in Resources_List. It
      now takes that value and allocates x processors packed on any available 
      node. (Ken Nielson Adaptive Computing. June 17, 2010)
  f - added full support (server-scheduler-mom) for Cygwin (UIIP NAS of Belarus,
      uiip.bas-net.by)
  b - fixed EINPROGRESS in net_client.c. This signal appears every time of 
      connecting and requires individual processing. The old erroneous 
      processing brought a large network delay, especially on Cygwin.
  e - improved signal processing after connecting in client_to_svr and added own
      implementation of bindresvport for OS which lack it (Igor Ilyenko, 
      UIIP Minsk)
  f - created permission checking of Windows (Cygwin) users, using mkpasswd, 
      mkgroup and own functions IamRoot, IamUser (Yauheni Charniauski, 
      UIIP Minsk)
  f - created permission checking of submitted jobs (Vikentsi Lapa, 
      UIIP Minsk)
  f - Added the --disable-daemons configure option for start server-sched-mom
      as Windows services, cygrunsrv.exe goes its into background 
      independently.
  e - Adapted output of Cygwin's diagnostic information (Yauheni 
      Charniauski, UIIP Minsk)
  b - Changed pbsd_main to call daemonize_server early only if 
      high_availability_mode is set.
  e - added new qmgr server attributes (clone_batch_size, clone_batch_delay)
      for controlling job cloning (Bugzilla #4)
  e - added new qmgr attribute (checkpoint_defaults) for setting default
      checkpoint values on Execution queues (Bugzilla #1)
  e - print a more informative error if pbs_iff isn't found when trying to
      authenticate a client
  e - added qmgr server attribute job_start_timeout, specifies timeout to be
      used for sending job to mom. If not set, tcp_timeout is used.
  e - added -DUSESAVEDRESOURCES code that uses servers saved resources used
      for accounting end record instead of current resources used for jobs that
      stopped running while mom was not up.
  e - TORQUE job arrays now use arrays to hold the job pointers and not 
      linked lists (allows constant lookup). 
  f - Allow users to delete a range of jobs from the job array (qdel -t)
  f - Added a slot limit to the job arrays - this restricts the number of 
      jobs that can concurrently run from one job array. 
  f - added support for holding ranges of jobs from an array with a single 
      qhold (using the -t option). 
  f - now ranges of jobs in an array can be modified through qalter 
      (using the -t option). 
  f - jobs can now depend on arrays using these dependencies: 
      afterstartarray, afterokarray, afternotokarray, afteranyarray, 
  f - added support for using qrls on arrays with the -t option
  e - complte overhaul of job array submission code
  f - by default show only a single entry in qstat output for the whole array
      (qstat -t expands the job array)
  f - server parameter max_job_array_size limits the number of jobs allowed
      in an array
  b - job arrays can no longer circumvent max_user_queuable
  b - job arrays can no longer circumvent max_queuable
  f - added server parameter max_slot_limit to restrict slot limits
  e - changed array names from jobid-index to jobid[index] for consistency

2.4.13
  e - change so blcr checkpoint jobs can restart on different node. Use
      configure --enable-blcr to allow. (Bugzilla 68, backported from 2.5.5)
  e - Add code to verify the group list as well when VALIDATEGROUPS is set in torque.cfg
      (backported from 3.0.1)
  b - Fix a bug where if geometry requests are enabled and cpusets are enabled, the cpuset
      wasn't deleted unless a geometry request was made. (backported from 3.0.1)
  b - Fix a race condition for pbs_mom -q, exitstatus was getting overwritten and as a result
      pbs_server wasn't always re-queued, but were being deleted instead. (backported from 3.0.1)
  b - allow apostrophes in Mail_Users attributes, as apostrophes are rare but legal email
      characters (backported from 3.0.1)
  b - Fixed a problem in parse_node_token where the local static variable pt would be advanced
      past the end of the line input if there is no newline character at the end of the nodes
      file.
  b - Updated torque.spec.in to be able to handle the snapshot
      names of builds.
  b - Merged revisions 4555, 4556 and 4557 from 2.5-fixes branch. This revisions fix problems in
      High availability mode and also a problem where the MOM was not releasing the lock on
      mom.lock on exit.
  b - fix pbs_mom -q to work with parallel jobs (backported from 3.0.1)
  b - fixed a bug in set_resources that prevented the last resource in a list from being
      checked. As a result the last item in the list would always be added
      without regard to previous entries.
  e - allow more than 5 concurrent connections to TORQUE using pbsD_connect. Increase it to 10
      (backported from 3.0.1)
  b - fix a segfault when receiving an obit for a job that no longer exists (backported from 3.0.1)
  b - Fixed a problem with minimum sizes in queues. Minimum sizes were not getting enforced because
      the logic checking the queue against the user request used and && when it need a || in the
      comparison.
  c - fix a segfault when queue has acl_group_enable and acl_group_sloppy set
      true and no acl_groups are defined. (backported from 3.0.1)
  e - To fix Bugzilla Bug 121 I created a thread in job_purge on the mom in the file src/resmom/job_func.c
      All job purging now happens on its own thread. If any of the system calls fail to return
      the thread will hang but the MOM will still be able to process work.
  e - Updated Makefile.in, configure, etc. to reflect change in configure.ac to add
      libpthread to the build. This was done for the fix for Bugzilla Bug 121.
  b - Added patch from Michael Jennings to buildutils/torque.spec.in. This patch
      allows an rpm configured with DRMAA to complete even if all of the
      support files are not present on the system.

2.4.12
  b - Bugzilla bug 84. Security bug on the way checkpoint is being handled.
      (Robin R. - Miami Univ. of Ohio, back-ported from 2.5.3)
  b - make the tcp reading buffer able to grow dynamically to read larger
      values in order to avoid "invalid protocol" messages (backported from
      2.5.3)
  b - could not set the server HA parameters lock_file_update_time and
      lock_file_check_time previously. Fixed. (backported from 2.5.3)
  e - qpeek now has the options --ssh, --rsh, --spool, --host, -o, and
      -e. Can now output both the STDOUT and STDERR files.  Eliminated
      numlines, which didn't work. (backported from 2.5.3)
  b - Modified the pbs_server startup routine to skip unknown hosts in the 
      nodes file instead of terminating the server startup.
  b - fix to prevent a possible segfault when using checkpointing (back-ported
      from 2.5.3).
  b - fix to cleanup job files on mom after a BLCR job is checkpointed and held
      (back-ported from 2.5.3)
  c - when using job_force_cancel_time, fix a crash in rare cases
      (backported from 2.5.4)
  b - fix a potential memory corruption for walltime remaining for jobs
      (Vikentsi Lapa, backported from 2.5.4)
  b - fix potential buffer overrun in pbs_sched (Bugzilla #98, patch from
      Stephen Usher @ University of Oxford, backported from 2.5.4)
  e - check if a process still exists before killing it and sleeping. This speeds up
      the time for killing a task exponentially, although this will show mostly for
      SMP/NUMA systems, but it will help everywhere. (backported from 2.5.4)
      (Dr. Bernd Kallies)
  e - Refactored torque spec file to comply with established RPM best
      practices, including the following:
         - Standard installation locations based on RPM macro configuration
           (e.g., %{_prefix})
         - Latest upstream RPM conditional build semantics with fallbacks for
                  older versions of RPM (e.g., RHEL4)
         - Initial set of optional features (GUI, PAM, syslog, SCP) with more
           planned
         - Basic working configuration automatically generated at install-time
         - Reduce the number of unnecessary subpackages by consolidating where
           it makes sense and using existing RPM features (e.g.,
           --excludedocs).
  b - Merged revision 4325 from 2.5-fixes. Fixed a problem where the -m n
      (request no mail on qsub) was not always being recongnized.
  b - Fix for reque failures on mom.  Forked pbs_mom would silently segfault and
      job was left in Exiting state. (backported from 2.5.4)
  b - prevent the nodes file from being overwritten when running make packages
  b - change so "mom_checkpoint_job_has_checkpoint" and "execing command" log
      messages do not always get logged (back-ported from 2.5.4)
  b - remove the use of a GNU specific function. (back-ported from 2.5.5)


2.4.11 
  b - changed type cast for calloc of ioenv from sizeof(char) to sizof(char *)
      in pbsdsh.c. This fixes bug 79.
  c - fix segfault in tracejob. It wasn't malloc'ing space for the null 
      terminator (back-ported from 2.5.3)
  b - Added patch to fix bug 76, "blocking read does not time out using 
      signal handler.
  b - Bugzilla bug 84. Security bug on the way checkpoint is being handled.
     (Robin R. - Miami Univ. of Ohio, back-ported from 2.5.3)
  b - Modified the pbs_server startup routine to skip unknown hosts in the 
      nodes file instead of terminating the server startup.

2.4.10
  b - fix for bug 61. The fix takes care of a problem where pbs_mom under
      some situations will change the mode and permissions of /dev/null.

2.4.9
  b - Bugzilla bug 57. Check return value of malloc for tracejob for Linux
      (Chris Samuel - Univ. of Melbourne)
  b - fix so "gres" config gets displayed by pbsnodes
  b - use QSUBHOST as the default host for output files when no host is
      specified. (RT 7678) 
  e - allow users to use cpusets and geometry requests at the same time by
      specifying both at configure time.
  b - Bugzilla bug 55. Check return value of malloc for pbs_mom for Linux
      (Chris Samuel - Univ. of Melbourne)
  e - added server parameter job_force_cancel_time. When configured to X 
      seconds, a job that is still there X seconds after a qdel will be
      purged. Useful for freeing nodes from a job when one node goes down
      midjob.
  b - fixed gcc warnings reported by Skip Montanaro
  e - added RPT_BAVAIL define that allows pbs_mom to report f_bavail instead of
      f_bfree on Linux systems
  b - no longer consider -t and -T the same in qsub
  e - make PBS_O_WORKDIR accessible in the environment for prolog scripts
  e - Bugzilla 59. Applied patch to allow '=' for qdel -m.
      (Chris Samuel - Univ. of Melbourne)
  b - properly escape characters (&"'<>) in XML output)
  b - ignore port when checking host in svr_get_privilege()
  b - restore ability to parse -W x=geometry:{...,...}
  e - from Simon Toth: If no available amount is specified for a resource 
      and the max limit is set, the requirement should be checked against 
      the maximum only (for scheduler, bugzilla 23). 
  b - check return values from fwrite in cpuset.c to avoid warnings
  e - expand acl host checking to allow * in the middle of hostnames, not 
      just at the beginning. Also allow ranges like a[10-15] to mean a10,
      a11, ..., a15.

2.4.8
  e - Bugzilla bug 22. HIGH_PRECISION_FAIRSHARE for fifo scheduling.
  c - no longer sigabrt with "running" jobs not in an execution queue. log
      an error. 
  c - fixed segfault for when TORQUE thinks there's a nanny but there isn't
  e - mapped 'qsub -P user:group' to qsub -P user -W group_list=group
  b - reverted to old behavior where interactive scripts are checked for 
      directives and not run without a parameter.
  e - setting a queue's resource_max.nodes now actually restricts things,
      although so far it only limits based on the number of nodes (i.e. not
      ppn)
  f - added QSUBSENDGROUPLIST to qsub. This allows the server to know the 
      correct group name when disable_server_id_check is set to true and
      the user doesn't exist on the server.
  e - Bugzilla bug 54. Patch submitted by Bas van der Vlies to make pbs_mkdirs
      more robust, provide a help function and new option -C <chk_tree_location> 

2.4.7
  b - fixed a bug for when a resource_list has been set, but isn't completely
      initialized, causing a segfault
  b - stop counting down walltime remaining after a job is completed
  b - correctly display the number for tasks as used in TORQUE in qstat -a output
  b - no longer ignoring fread return values in linux cpuset code (gcc 4.3.3)
  b - fixed a bug where job was added to obit retry list multiple times, causing
      a segfault
  b - Fix for Bugzilla bug 43. "configure ignores with-modulefiles=no"
  b - no longer try to decide when to start with -t create in init.d scripts, 
      -t creates should be done manually by the user
  f - added -P to qsub. When submitting a job as root, the root user may add -P
      <username> to submit the job as the proxy user specified by <usermname>

2.4.6
  f - added an asynchronous option for qsig, specified with -a.
  b - fix to cleanup job that is left in running state after mom restart
  f - added two server parameters: display_job_server_suffix and job_suffix_alias.
      The first defaults to true and is whether or not jobs should be appended
      by .server_name. The second defaults to NULL, but if it is defined it
      will be appended at the end of the jobid, i.e. jobid.job_suffix_alias.
  f - added -l option to qstat so that it will display a server name and an
      alias if both are used. If these aren't used, -l has no effect.
  e - qstat -f now includes an extra field "Walltime Remaining" that tells 
      the remaining walltime in seconds. This field is does not account for
      weighted walltime.
  b - fixed open_std_file to setegid as well, this caused a problem with 
      epilogue.user scripts.
  e - qsub's -W can now parse attributes with quoted lists, for example: 
      qsub script -W attr="foo,foo1,foo2,foo3" will set foo,foo1,foo2,foo3
      as attr's value.
  b - split Cray job library and CSA functionality since CSA is dependant on job
      library but job library is not dependant on CSA

2.4.5
  b - epilogue.user scripts were being run with prologue argments. Fixed
      bug in run_pelog() to include PE_EPILOGUSER so epilogue arguments get
      passed to eplilogue.user script.
  b - Ticket 6665. pbs_mom and job recovery. Fixed a bug where the -q option 
      would terminate running processes as well as requeue jobs. This made the
      -q option the same as the -r option for pbs_mom. -q will now only reque 
      jobs and will not attempt to kill running processes. I also added a -P
      option to start pbs_mom. This is similar to the -p option except the -P
      option will only delete any left over jobs from the queue and will not
      attempt to adopt and running processes.
  e - Modified man page for pbs_mom. Added new -P option plus edited -p, -q
      and -r options to hopefully make them more understandable.
  n - 01/15/2010 created snapshot torque-2.4.5-snap201001151416.tar.gz.
  b - now checks secondary groups (as well as primary) for creating a file
      when spooling.  Before it wouldn't create the spool file if a user had 
      permission through a secondary group.
  n - 01/18/2010. Items above this point merged into trunk.
  b - fixed a file descriptor error with high availability. Before it was possible
      to try to regain a file descriptor which was never held, now this is fixed.
  b - No longer overwrites the user's environment when spoolasfinalname is set.
      Now the environment is handled correctly.
  b - No longer will segfault if pbs_mom restarts in a bad state (user environment 
      not initialized)
  e - Changing MAXNOTDEFAULT behavior.  Now, by default, max is not default and max
      can be configured as default with --enable-maxdefault.

2.4.4
  b - fixed contrib/init.d/pbs_mom so that it doesn't overwrite $args defined in
      /etc/sysconfig/pbs_mom
  b - when spool_as_final_name is configured for the mom, no longer send email 
      messages about not being able to copy the spool file
  b - when spool_as_final_name is configured for the mom, correctly substitue 
      job environment variables
  f - added logging for email events, allows the admin to check if emails are 
      being sent correctly
  b - Made a fix to svr_get_privilege(). On some architectures a non-root user
      name would be set to null after the line " host_no_port[num_host_chars] = 0;"
      because num_host_chars was = 1024 which was the size of hot_no_port. 
      The null termination needed to happen at 1023. There were other problems
      with this function so code was added to  validate the incoming
      variables before they were used. The symptom of this bug was that non-root
      managers and operators could not perform operations where they should 
      have had rights.
  b - Missed a format statement in an sprintf statement for the bug fix above.
  b - Fixed a way that a file descriptor (for the server lockfile) could be used without 
      initialization. RT 6756

2.4.3
  b - fix PBSD_authenticate so it correctly splits PATH with : instead of ;
      (bugzilla #33)

      Samuel, VPAC)
  c - fix assumption about size of unsocname.sun_path in Libnet/net_server.c
  b - Fix for Bugzilla bug 34. "torque 2.4.X breaks OSC's mpiexec". fix in src/server
      src/server/stat_job.c revision 3268.
  b - Fix for Bugzilla bug 35 - printing the wrong pid (normal mode) and not
      printing any pid for high availability mode.
  f - added a diagnostic script (contrib/diag/tdiag.sh).  This script grabs 
      the log files for the server and the mom, records the output of qmgr 
      -c 'p s' and the nodefile, and creates a tarfile containing these.
  b - Changed momctl -s to use exit(EXIT_FAILURE) instead of return(-1) if 
      a mom is not running.
  b - Fix for Bugzilla bug 36. "qsub crashes with long dependency list".
  b - Fix for Bugzilla bug 41. "tracejob creates a file in the local directory".

2.4.2
  b - Changed predicate in pbsd_main.c for the two locations where 
      daemonize_server is called to check for the value of high_availability_mode 
      to determine when to put the server process in the background.
  b - Added pbs_error_db.h to src/include/Makefile.am and src/include/Makefile.in. 
      pbs_error_db.h now needed for install.
  e - Modified pbs_get_server_list so the $TORQUE_HOME/server_name file will work with 
      a comma delimited string or a list of server names separated by a new line.
  b - fix tracejob so it handles multiple server and mom logs for the same day
  f - Added a new server parameter np_default. This allows the administrator to
      change the number of processors to a unified value dynamically for the
      entire cluster.
  e - high availability enhanced so that the server spawns a separate thread to
      update the "lock" on the lockfile.  Thread update and check time are both
      setable parameters in qmgr.
  b - close empty ACL files
  
2.4.1
  e - added a prologue and epilogue option to the list of resources for qsub -l
      which allows a per job prologue or epilogue script. The syntax for
      the new option is qsub -l prologue=<prologue script>, 
      epilogue=<epilogue script>
  f - added a "-w" option to qsub to override the working directory
  e - changes needed to allow relocatable checkpoint jobs. Job checkpoint files
      are now under the control of the server.
  c - check filename for NULL to prevent crash
  b - changed so we don't try to copy a local file when the destination is a
      directory and the file is already in that directory
  f - changes to allow TORQUE to operate without pbs_iff (merged from 2.3)
  e - made logging functions rentrant safe by using localtime_r instead of
      localtime() (merged from 2.3)

  e - merged in new log_ext() function to allow more fine grained syslog events, 
      you can now specify severity level. Also added more logging statements
  b - fixed a bug where CPU time was not being added up properly in all cases 
      (fix for Linux only) 
  c - fixed a few memory errors due to some uninitialized memory being allocated
      (ported from 2.3 R2493)
  e - added code to allow compilers to override CLONE_BATCH_SIZE at configure
      time (allows for finer grained control on how arrays are created) (ported
      from Yahoo R2461)
  e - added code which prefixes the severity tag on all log_ext() and log_err()
      messages (ported from Yahoo R2358)
  f - added code from 2.3-extreme that allows TORQUE to handle more than 1024 sockets.
      Also, increased the size of TORQUE's internal socket handle table to avoid
      running out of handles under busy conditions.
  e - TORQUE can now handle server names larger than 64 bytes (now set to 1024,
      which should be larger than the max for hostnames)
  e - added qmgr option accounting_keep_days, specifies how long to keep
      accounting files.
  e - changed mom config varattr so invoked script returns the varattr name
      and value(s)
  e - improved the performance of pbs_server when submitting large numbers of
      jobs with dependencies defined
  e - added new parameter "log_keep_days" to both pbs_server and pbs_mom.

      is located
  b - change so we use default file name for output / error file when just a
      directory is specified on qsub / qalter -e -o options
  e - modified to allow retention of completed jobs across server shutdown
  e - added job_must_report qmgr configuration which says the job must be 
      reported to scheduler. Added job attribute "reported". Added PURGECOMP 
      functionality which allows scheduler to confirm jobs are reported. Also 
      added -c option to qdel. Used to clean up unreported jobs.
  b - Fix so interactive jobs run when using $job_output_file_umask userdefault
  f - Allow adding extra End accounting record for a running job that is rerun.
      Provides usage data.  Enabled by CFLAGS=-DRERUNUSAGE.
  b - Fix to use queue/server resources_defaults to validate mppnodect against
      resources_max when mppwidth or mppnppn are not specified for job
  f - merged in new dynamic array struct and functions to implement a new (and
      more efficient) way of loading jobs at startup--should help by 2 orders of
      magnitude!
  f - changed TORQUE_MAXCONNECTTIMEOUT to be a global variable that is now 
      changed by the MOM to be smaller than the pbs_server and is also
      configurable on the MOM ($max_conn_timeout_micro_sec)
  e - change so queued jobs that get deleted go to complete and get displayed
      in qstat based on keep_completed
  b - Changes to improve the qstat -x XML output and documentation

  f - add qpool.gz to contrib directory
  e - improve how error constants and text messages are represented (Simon Toth,
      CESNET z.s.p.o)
  f - new boolean queue attribute "is_transit" that allows jobs to exceede 
      server resource limits (queue limits are respected). This allows routing 
      queues to route jobs that would be rejected for exceeding local resources
      even when the job won't be run locally. (Simon Toth, CESNET z.s.p.o)
  e - add support for "job_array" as a type for queue disallowed_types attribute

      Linux. Configure option --enable-csa will cause workload management 
      records to be written if CSA is installed and wkmg is turned on.
  b - changes to allow post_checkpoint() to run when checkpoint is completed,
      not when it has just started. Also corrected issue when checkpoint fails
      while trying to put job on hold.
  b - update server immediately with changed checkpoint name and time attributes
      after successful checkpoint.
  e - Changes so checkpoint jobs failing after restarted are put on hold or
      requeued

  b - change so set_jobexid() gets called if JOB_ATR_egroup is not set
  e - pbs_mom sisters can now tolerate an explicit group ID instead of only a
      valid group name. This helps TORQUE be more robust to group lookup failures.

  b - corrected pbs_server man page for SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2
  f - added new pbs_track command which may be used to launch an external 
      process and a pbs_mom will then track the resource usage of that process

      Singleton and David Houlder from APAC)
  e - added alternate method for sending cluster addresses to mom 
      (ALT_CLSTR_ADDR)

  f - when using qsub it is now possible to specify both -k and -o/-e
      (before -o/-e did not behave as expected if -k was also used)
  e - changed pbs_server to have "-l" option. Specifies a host/port that event
      messages will be sent to. Event messages are the same as what the
      scheduler currently receives.
  e - added --enable-autorun to allow qsub jobs to automatically try to run
      if there are any nodes available.
  e - added --enable-quickcommit to allow qsub to combine the ready to commit
      and commit phases into 1 network transmission.
  e - added --enable-nochildsignal to allow pbs_server to use inline checking
      for SIGCHLD instead of using the signal handler.

      is not found set it to "".
  b - fix qdel of entire job arrays for non operator/managers
  b - fix so we continue to process exiting jobs for other servers

  b - reset ji_momhandle so we cannot have more than one pjob for obit_reply to
      find.
  e - change qdel to accept 'ALL' as well as 'all'
  b - changed order of searching so we find most recent jobs first. Prevents
