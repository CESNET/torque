How to Install using autoconf'ed TORQUE.


- untar the tar file and cd to the top level directory

- run "./configure" with the options set appropriately for your
  installation. (See 'CONFIGURE' note below)

- run "make" (See 'BUILD' note below)

- run "make install"


-------------------------------------------------------------------

CONFIGURE: It is advisable to create a simple shell script
  that calls configure with the appropriate options so that you
  can save typing on reconfigures. If you have already run configure
  you can remake all of the Makefiles by running "./config.status".
  Also, looking at the first few lines of config.status will
  tell you the options that were set when configure was run.
  To figure out which options one can set run "./configure --help"
  

BUILD: You need to use a POSIX (or nearly POSIX) make. GNU make
  works quite well in this regard; BSD make does not. If you are
  having any sort of build problems, your make should be a prime suspect.
  Tremendous effort has been expended to provide proper dependency
  generation and makefiles without relying on any non-POSIX features. 
  The build should work fine with a simple call to make, however,
  complicating things by using various make flags is not guaranteed
  to work. Don't be surprised if the first thing that make does is
  call configure again. See the note in Makefile.in if this happens.


MAC: If building for a Mac OS/X cluster, some users have reported issues 
  with using the tool 'stuffit' (corrupt the creation of the library 
  libpbs.a).  To work around this, download the file to the desktop, 
  open up the terminal and unpack it manually with gzip and tar.  

  If using 'bash' as the job execution shell, '.bashrc' may not be 
  executed.  Use '#!/bin/bash -l' at the start of the pbs command file
  to force this script to be run.


TRU64/DIGITALUNIX: If building for a TRU64/Digital Unix cluster, some
  users have reported problems building pbs_mom.  To correct this add
  the path to librt.a (ie, '/usr/lib/librt.a') to the pbs_mom linker 
  line in ~/src/resmom/Makefile


CONFIGURATION: Once built, see online docs for MOM, scheduler, and 
  server configuration

  MOM:       http://clusterresources.com/torquedocs/1.1momconfig.shtml
  scheduler: http://clusterresources.com/moabdocs/pbsintegration.shtml
