Installation
============

To compile the library just go to the main source directory and type:

 ./configure [--prefix=/installation/directory] && make

If you had installed Torque in a non standard directory pass it
in --with-pbs configure parameter.
If you have taken sources directly from a CVS repository you would
need _gperf_ perfect hash function generator for compilation
(http://www.gnu.org/projects/gperf).

For further information regarding GNU build system see the INSTALL file.

To setup and use the DRMAA 1.0 library a default Torque batch queue must be configured so
it leaves jobs after the completion. To achieve this simply type the following commands:

 $ qmgr
 Qmgr: set queue batch keep_completed = 60
 Qmgr: quit

The actual value of the keep_completed parameter denotes a number of seconds jobs 
will have to wait in the queue after the completion. It enables the DRMAA library 
to retrieve the information about finished jobs.

Known bugs and limitations
==========================

The PBS DRMAA 1.0 library is meant to be compliant with the Global Grid Forum DRMAA
1.0 specification. Although Torque APIs impose some limitations:
  - Waiting functions (drmaa_wait() and drmaa_synchronize())
    must pool DRM to find out whether job finished.
  - Resource usage information is not provided.
  - "start_time" attribute is missing.
  - Job termination (when job is running) is realized
    by Torque by sending SIGTERM and/or SIGKILL
    therefore retrieving those signals cannot be distinguished
    from abort using drmaa_control(DRMAA_CONTROL_TERMINATE).
    Then job termination state is marked as "aborted"
    and "signaled" whatever is the state.
  - drmaa_wcoredump() always returns false.
